Seven headhunting firms dominate PE placement in North America. They control which candidates get shown to which funds—and understanding their specialties, coverage, and preferences can make or break your recruiting process.

This isn't about "networking with headhunters." It's about understanding the gatekeepers who determine whether your resume ever reaches Blackstone, KKR, or Apollo.

## How the Headhunter System Works

Headhunters begin building candidate profiles as soon as new analyst classes hit the desk. They maintain relationships with PE funds and are paid by those funds to source candidates—not by you.

This creates important dynamics:

- **They rank candidates.** Every conversation is evaluative, even "informal" calls.
- **They segment by tier.** A-list candidates get shown to megafunds first; B-list fills secondary positions.
- **They remember everything.** Your profile impression sticks permanently.
- **They talk to each other.** Reputation travels across the headhunter ecosystem.

Even if a headhunter tells you a chat will be "purely informational," that is likely not true. Treat every interaction as an interview from minute one.

## The A-List vs. B-List Reality

Headhunters maintain ranked candidate lists that determine which firms see your profile:

**A-List (Top 10-20%):** GS/MS/EVR M&A from target school with 3.8+ GPA and strong presence. Gets priority megafund slots, multiple firm options, and proactive headhunter advocacy.

**B-List (Next 30-40%):** Remaining BB/EB analysts from good schools. Fills secondary megafund positions and upper-middle-market slots. Must work harder to stand out.

**C-List and Below:** MM bank analysts, non-target backgrounds. Typically not shown to megafunds regardless of preparation. Best path is MM/LMM PE or off-cycle recruiting.

This is the uncomfortable truth: headhunter access is heavily filtered by pedigree before they evaluate anything else.

## The Seven Firms That Control PE Access

### Tier 1: Blue-Chip Megafund Coverage

#### CPI (Cromwell Partners International)

**Founded:** 1996 by Brian O'Callaghan  
**Processes:** 3,000 candidates annually  
**Unique factor:** The ONLY headhunter that asks paper LBO questions in initial meetings

**Key coverage:**
- Advent International
- Hellman & Friedman
- Silver Lake
- Thomas H. Lee Partners
- American Securities
- New Mountain Capital
- GTCR
- Ares Management
- Platinum Equity

**Strategy:** Save CPI for late in your headhunter meeting sequence. When your story is polished and you can handle cold technical questions, then you're ready for CPI. Going in unprepared is a permanent mistake.

#### Henkel Search Partners (HSP)

**Founded:** 2011 by former Morgan Stanley MD Eleni Henkel (ex-SG Partners)  
**Offices:** New York, San Francisco  
**Reputation:** Consistently rated "most pleasant to work with"

**Key coverage:**
- KKR (all groups and offices)
- Carlyle Group
- Warburg Pincus
- Vista Equity Partners
- Clayton, Dubilier & Rice
- BC Partners
- TPG Growth/Rise
- Tiger Global
- Blackstone Energy/Special Situations

**Strategy:** Prioritize this relationship. You get a pleasant experience AND excellent megafund coverage. Save for your later meetings when you're polished, but don't skip them.

#### SG Partners

**Founded:** Early 1990s by Sheri Gellman ("one of the original talent sourcers")  
**Unique coverage:** Boutique banks (Centerview, Allen & Co)

**Key coverage:**
- Blackstone (main PE fund)
- Sixth Street
- Summit Partners
- Global Infrastructure Partners
- Crestview Partners

**Reputation:** Mixed—some complaints about leaked confidential information, but they have key megafund relationships you can't access otherwise.

**Strategy:** Essential if you're targeting Blackstone. Despite reputation concerns, this is sometimes the only path to BX's main PE fund.

### Tier 2: Strong Coverage with Specializations

#### Ratio Advisors

**Led by:** Vedica Qalbani (ex-Amity Search Partners)  
**Offices:** NYC, Boston, San Francisco  
**Specialty:** PRIMARY headhunter for growth equity

**Key coverage:**
- Apollo Global Management
- General Atlantic
- Francisco Partners
- Charlesbank Capital
- Golden Gate Capital
- Thrive Capital
- Bessemer Venture Partners
- Ribbit Capital

**Strategy:** Essential if you're targeting growth equity. Also has a strong Apollo relationship—one of the few paths to Apollo PE beyond their own recruiting.

#### Amity Search Partners

**Team:** 15 recruiters across NYC, SF, Austin, San Diego  
**Reputation:** Great to work with, less blue-chip but reliable

**Key coverage:**
- Bain Capital
- Centerbridge Partners
- Trian Partners
- Clearlake Capital
- H.I.G. Capital

**Strategy:** Strong middle-market coverage with a pleasant experience. Good for UMM targets and practice before your Tier 1 meetings.

#### Dynamics Search Partners (DSP)

**Focus:** 75% hedge fund placements, 25% PE  
**Specialty:** Texas/energy fund strength

**Key coverage:**
- Apax Partners
- Leonard Green & Partners
- Farallon Capital
- GI Partners
- Coatue Management
- Quantum Energy Partners
- Tailwater Capital

**Strategy:** Strong choice if you're targeting hedge fund crossover roles or Texas-based energy funds. Less relevant for pure buyout megafund recruiting.

#### Oxbridge Group

**Focus:** Middle-market and hedge fund  
**Reputation:** "Not nice, but not unethical"—engage professionally

**Key coverage:**
- Genstar Capital
- Jordan Company
- Great Hill Partners
- Vector Capital
- Gryphon Investors

**Strategy:** Essential for middle-market targeting. Don't expect warmth, but expect results. These relationships matter for MM seats that aren't on most candidates' radar.

## Proactive Headhunter Outreach Strategy

### When to Reach Out

**Timing:** 2-3 weeks before expected on-cycle kickoff (early July for 2026 recruiting).

Don't wait for them to find you. If you're not on their radar, proactive outreach signals seriousness.

### Email Template That Works

```
Subject: [Bank] [Group] Analyst — PE Recruiting Introduction

Hi [Name],

I'm a first-year analyst in [Group] at [Bank] and wanted to introduce 
myself ahead of the upcoming recruiting cycle. I'm focused on [buyout/growth] 
opportunities, particularly interested in [sector/geography].

Would welcome the chance to connect when you have a few minutes.

Best,
[Your name]
```

Keep it short. They receive hundreds of these. Specificity about your focus signals you've thought about this seriously.

### Recommended Meeting Sequence

**Week 1:** Amity, Oxbridge (practice reps—lower stakes, refine your story)

**Week 2:** DSP, Ratio (mid-tier coverage, continue refining)

**Week 3:** Henkel, SG Partners, CPI (save the best for last when you're sharp)

This sequence lets you practice on lower-stakes conversations before the headhunters with the best megafund coverage see you at your most polished.

## What Triggers Headhunter Outreach to You

Headhunters don't reach out randomly. Here's how they build their initial target lists:

| Factor | Top Tier (A-List) | Second Tier (B-List) | Limited Access |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Bank | GS, MS, JPM M&A | Other BB, Top EB | MM, Regional |
| Group | M&A, Sponsors, RX | Industry Coverage | Non-deal groups |
| University | Harvard, Penn, Stanford | Other Ivy, Top 10 | Non-target |
| GPA | 3.8+ | 3.5-3.8 | Below 3.5 |
| Deal Experience | 2+ closed deals | 1 closed deal | No closed deals |

If you're not checking most boxes in the A-List column, you need to outwork your competition on preparation and networking to compensate.

## Mistakes That Permanently Damage Your Candidacy

These errors follow you across cycles. Headhunters have long memories.

1. **Reneging on a signed offer** — Done with that firm and headhunter permanently
2. **Lying about anything** — Bank, GPA, deal involvement; the PE world is small
3. **Being unprepared for HH meetings** — They rank you against everyone they meet that day
4. **Vague preferences ("I like everything")** — Signals indecision, gets tracked
5. **Leaking process information** — Reputation follows you across cycles
6. **Being difficult to schedule** — Signals you're not serious
7. **Badmouthing current employer** — Red flag for professionalism

The headhunter ecosystem is small and interconnected. One bad impression can close doors you didn't know existed.

## The Bottom Line

Headhunters are gatekeepers, not advocates—until you prove yourself. Understanding which firms cover which funds, approaching them in the right sequence, and treating every interaction as evaluative gives you an edge over candidates who stumble into the process unprepared.

The candidates who win on-cycle aren't necessarily smarter or more experienced. They're the ones who understood how the system works before they entered it.
