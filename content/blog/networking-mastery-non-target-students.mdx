At target schools, banks come to campus. At non-target schools, you go to the banks—one email at a time. Networking isn't optional for non-target students; it's the entire strategy. Without it, your online applications disappear into a black hole.

Here's the complete networking playbook that actually gets non-target students into investment banking.

## The Non-Target Networking Reality

Let's be direct about the numbers:

**Target school students** can often land interviews with 10-20 networking calls plus on-campus recruiting access.

**Non-target students** typically need 80-150+ cold emails, 40-60+ completed calls, and 3-5 strong advocates to have a realistic shot at interviews.

This isn't meant to discourage you—it's meant to set realistic expectations so you don't give up after 20 emails with no responses. The process works, but it requires volume and persistence.

## The Three Types of Connections to Target

### Tier 1: Alumni (Highest Response Rate)

Alumni from your school—even if it's not a target—feel an obligation to help current students. This is your warmest outreach.

**How to find them:**
- LinkedIn search: "[Your School]" + "Investment Banking"
- Your school's alumni database
- Career services alumni lists
- Ask professors for introductions

**Why they respond:** Shared identity creates implicit trust. They remember what it was like to recruit from your school.

### Tier 2: Regional/Geographic Connections

People from your hometown, state, or region have an affinity that can substitute for alumni ties.

**How to use it:**
- "I'm from [City] and noticed you're originally from [same area]"
- Reference local landmarks, sports teams, or experiences
- Works particularly well for smaller cities or regions with tight-knit communities

### Tier 3: Cold Outreach (Lowest Response Rate, Highest Volume)

When you have no shared connection, you're relying purely on their goodwill and your email quality.

**What improves cold response rates:**
- Reference a specific deal they worked on
- Demonstrate genuine knowledge of their group/coverage
- Be concise and professional
- Follow up appropriately

## The 100-Email Framework

### Phase 1: Build Your List (Week 1)

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:
- Name, Title, Bank, Group
- Email address
- Connection type (alumni, geographic, cold)
- LinkedIn profile link
- Date sent, Follow-up dates
- Response status
- Call scheduled (Y/N)
- Notes

**Target:** 100+ names before you start sending.

**Sources:**
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (if available) or regular LinkedIn search
- Bank websites (team pages)
- Deal announcements (find who worked on deals)
- Alumni databases

### Phase 2: Prioritize and Segment (Week 1)

Sort your list by connection strength:
1. **Direct alumni** (same school, any level) — Email first
2. **Alumni of alumni connections** (someone who knows your alumni) — Email second
3. **Geographic connections** — Email third
4. **Cold outreach** — Fill in gaps

**Within each tier, prioritize:**
- Analysts and Associates (more likely to respond, closer to your level)
- VPs (good balance of access and willingness to help)
- MDs (lower response rate, but powerful if they respond)

### Phase 3: Execute at Volume (Weeks 2-8)

**Weekly targets:**
- Send 15-20 new emails per week
- Follow up on all non-responses from previous weeks
- Complete 5-10 calls per week (as responses come in)

**Tracking discipline:**
- Update your spreadsheet daily
- Log every response (positive or negative)
- Note key takeaways from every call

### Phase 4: Convert Calls to Advocates (Ongoing)

Not every call needs to become a deep relationship. But you need 3-5 people who will actively push for you.

**Signs someone might become an advocate:**
- They offer to connect you with others
- They ask about your timeline and target firms
- They express genuine interest in helping
- They follow up with you proactively

**How to nurture potential advocates:**
- Send thank-you emails within 24 hours
- Provide updates on your progress (every 4-6 weeks)
- Share relevant articles or insights occasionally
- Ask for specific help when appropriate (not too often)

## The Anatomy of a Great Networking Call

### Before the Call (5 min)
- Review their LinkedIn and background
- Prepare 3-4 specific questions
- Have your story ready (2-minute "walk me through your resume")

### Opening (2 min)
- Thank them for their time
- Brief introduction (who you are, why you reached out)

### Their Story (8-10 min)
- "How did you get into banking?"
- "What's your group's focus?"
- "What do you enjoy most about the work?"

Let them talk. People enjoy sharing their experience, and you learn valuable information.

### Your Questions (5-7 min)
- Specific questions about their group, deals, or career path
- Questions about recruiting timeline and process
- Ask for advice specific to your situation

### The Close (2-3 min)
**Critical question:** "Is there anyone else you'd recommend I speak with?"

This is how you expand your network exponentially. Every call should generate 1-2 new names.

### After the Call
- Send thank-you email within 24 hours
- Connect on LinkedIn (mention the call)
- Add any referrals to your outreach list immediately

## Following Up Without Being Annoying

### The Follow-Up Cadence

**After initial email (no response):**
- Wait 5-7 business days
- Send a short bump: "Just wanted to bump this in case it got buried"

**After first follow-up (no response):**
- Wait another 5-7 days
- Final attempt: "I'll try one last time—if you're too busy, is there someone else you'd recommend?"

**After two follow-ups:** Move on. Don't email again for 6 months.

### After a Completed Call

**Immediate (within 24 hours):**
- Thank-you email

**4-6 weeks later:**
- Progress update: "Wanted to share an update—I just landed an internship at [Firm] and wanted to thank you again for your advice"

**When something relevant happens:**
- "I saw [Bank] just closed [Deal]—congratulations to the team"

## Common Non-Target Networking Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Giving Up Too Early

Many students send 20-30 emails, get discouraged by low response rates, and quit. The students who break in send 100+.

### Mistake 2: Only Targeting Senior Bankers

MDs are busy and have low response rates. Analysts and Associates remember what recruiting was like and are more likely to help.

### Mistake 3: Asking for a Job in the First Email

Your first email asks for advice and information. Mentioning job-seeking triggers an automatic "talk to HR" response.

### Mistake 4: Not Tracking Rigorously

Without a system, you'll lose track of who you've contacted, who needs follow-up, and what you learned.

### Mistake 5: Treating Networking as a One-Time Event

Networking isn't just for recruiting season. Build relationships year-round. The person you talk to sophomore year might help you junior year.

## What to Do When Someone Offers to Help

When someone says "Let me know how I can help" or "I'll put in a word," follow up appropriately:

**If they offer a referral:**
> "Thank you so much—I really appreciate that. I'll have my resume ready to send over. Is there anything specific you'd recommend I highlight?"

**If they offer to connect you with others:**
> "That would be incredibly helpful. I'll send over a brief intro paragraph you can forward if that makes it easier."

**If they offer general advice:**
> "Thank you—I'll definitely keep that in mind as I continue recruiting. Would it be okay if I reach out in a few weeks with an update on how things are going?"

## The Advocate Effect

Here's why all this matters: When recruiting decisions are made, having someone inside the bank who knows your name changes everything.

**Without an advocate:** Your resume is one of thousands. HR screens by GPA and school name. You're filtered out before a human reviews you.

**With an advocate:** A VP mentions your name to recruiting. HR pulls your resume for review. You get an interview you wouldn't have gotten otherwise.

This is how non-target students break in. Not by being the most qualified on paper—but by having someone on the inside who can vouch for them.
