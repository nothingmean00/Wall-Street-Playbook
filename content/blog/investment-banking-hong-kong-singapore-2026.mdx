Hong Kong and Singapore are the two dominant investment banking hubs in Asia-Pacific. Together, they house the regional headquarters of every bulge bracket bank, most elite boutiques, and a growing ecosystem of local and regional firms.

But banking in Asia is not a copy-paste of New York. The deals are different, the recruiting process has its own rules, the culture is distinct, and one language skill has become quietly non-negotiable. If you're targeting Asia IB—whether you're based in the region or considering a move from the US or Europe—this guide covers everything you need to know.

> **Preparing for technicals?** The core interview questions are the same globally. Our [Finance Technical Interview Guide](/playbooks/finance-technical-interview-guide) covers every question tagged by frequency with 30-second and 3-minute answer formats. Master the fundamentals before your first interview.

## Hong Kong vs. Singapore: Which Hub Is Right for You?

### Hong Kong

**The deal flow:** Hong Kong is the gateway to Greater China. The majority of deal activity involves mainland Chinese companies—IPOs, cross-border M&A, and capital markets transactions. If you want exposure to the world's second-largest economy, Hong Kong is where the action is.

**The reality in 2026:**
- Deal activity is recovering after a challenging 2022-2024 period driven by regulatory crackdowns and geopolitical tensions
- Chinese IPO activity, once Hong Kong's crown jewel, has shifted—many companies now list on mainland exchanges (Shanghai, Shenzhen)
- Cross-border M&A remains active, particularly outbound Chinese acquisitions in Southeast Asia and the Middle East
- Banks are cautiously rebuilding headcount after significant layoffs in 2023-2024

**Language:** Mandarin is now effectively essential for Hong Kong IB roles, even though it's rarely listed as a formal requirement. Cantonese is valuable for local client relationships but Mandarin is the deal language. If you don't speak Mandarin, your career ceiling in Hong Kong IB will be significantly lower than peers who do.

**Lifestyle:** Hong Kong is expensive—among the most costly cities in the world for housing. Expect to share a small apartment for the first few years. The work-life balance is similar to New York: long hours, demanding clients, and the expectation of being always available.

### Singapore

**The deal flow:** Singapore has emerged as the alternative to Hong Kong for banks hedging their China exposure. Deal activity centers on Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines), India-linked transactions, and increasingly, Middle East capital flows.

**The reality in 2026:**
- Singapore is the fastest-growing IB hub in Asia-Pacific
- Multiple banks have shifted senior coverage bankers from Hong Kong to Singapore
- Southeast Asian M&A is booming, driven by infrastructure spending, tech consolidation, and family-office-driven transactions
- The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has created a favorable regulatory environment that attracts global capital

**Language:** English is the primary business language. Mandarin is a significant advantage (many clients are ethnic Chinese business owners across Southeast Asia) but not as critical as in Hong Kong. Bahasa Malay/Indonesian is a differentiator for Indonesia-focused coverage.

**Lifestyle:** Singapore is expensive but more livable than Hong Kong—better housing quality, lower taxes, excellent public infrastructure. The hours are generally similar to Hong Kong, though some bankers report slightly better work-life balance compared to the Hong Kong grind.

### The Bottom Line

| Factor | Hong Kong | Singapore |
|---|---|---|
| Deal focus | Greater China, mainland IPOs | Southeast Asia, India, Middle East |
| Language | Mandarin essential | English primary, Mandarin a plus |
| Growth trajectory | Stabilizing after decline | Rapidly growing |
| Cost of living | Very high | High |
| Visa/work permit | Straightforward for finance | Competitive but achievable |
| Exit opportunities | PE/HF (China-focused) | PE/VC (SEA-focused), family offices |

## Compensation: Asia vs. New York

Let's address the elephant in the room. Asia IB pays less than New York—but the gap is narrower than you might think.

### 2026 Analyst Compensation

| Level | New York (USD) | Hong Kong (USD equiv.) | Singapore (USD equiv.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analyst 1 Base | $110,000 | $85,000-90,000 | $85,000-90,000 |
| Analyst 1 Bonus | $80,000-100,000 | $47,000-58,000 | $47,000-58,000 |
| Analyst 1 Total | $190,000-210,000 | $132,000-148,000 | $132,000-148,000 |
| Analyst 2 Base | $120,000 | $95,000-100,000 | $95,000-100,000 |
| Analyst 2 Bonus | $100,000-130,000 | $57,000-65,000 | $57,000-65,000 |
| Analyst 3 Base | $130,000 | $105,000-110,000 | $105,000-110,000 |

**Key nuances:**
- Hong Kong and Singapore pay roughly **20-30% less** than New York at the analyst level
- Bonuses in Asia average **55-65% of base**, compared to 70-100% in New York
- Singapore has significantly lower taxes than both Hong Kong and New York, partially closing the after-tax gap
- Hong Kong has no capital gains tax and a flat income tax rate (~15%), making the effective take-home competitive
- Deferred compensation is rare in Asia—only 5-10% of analysts receive deferred bonuses

**The tax advantage matters.** A Singapore analyst earning $140,000 total may take home more after tax than a New York analyst earning $180,000, depending on filing status and deductions.

## Recruiting Timeline: How Asia Differs

### For Undergrads at Asian Universities

The Asia recruiting timeline overlaps with but differs from the US cycle:

**September-October 2025:** Major banks open applications for summer 2026 analyst programs in Hong Kong and Singapore. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and HSBC all recruit on this timeline.

**November-January:** First-round interviews (HireVue, phone screens, online assessments)

**February-April 2026:** Assessment centers, Superdays, and offers. Some banks run in-person assessment centers where candidates complete group exercises, case studies, and individual interviews over 1-2 days.

**Key differences from US recruiting:**
- Assessment centers (group exercises + case studies) are more common in Asia than in the US, where Superdays are purely interview-based
- Language tests may be included (written Mandarin or verbal assessments)
- Some banks run separate tracks for different divisions (IBD, Markets, Research)
- The process is generally less networked than the US—cold applications have a higher success rate at Asian offices

### For US-Based Candidates Targeting Asia

If you're at a US university and want to recruit for Asia offices:
- Apply through the bank's Asia-Pacific portal, not the US portal
- Highlight language skills prominently on your resume
- Network with bankers in the specific Asian office—New York contacts can't help you with Hong Kong recruiting
- Be prepared to explain your connection to the region (family, study abroad, cultural ties, deal interest)
- Some banks allow you to preference a region during the application process; others require separate applications

## The Deal Landscape in Asia

Understanding what you'll actually work on is critical for interviews and for deciding if Asia IB is right for you.

### Hong Kong: China-Centric Deals

**Typical transactions:**
- Chinese company IPOs on HKEX (though volume has declined)
- Cross-border M&A: Chinese companies acquiring assets in Southeast Asia, Europe, or Africa
- Restructuring and liability management for Chinese property developers
- H-share and Red Chip offerings
- Convertible bond issuances for Chinese tech companies

**Sectors that dominate:** Technology, healthcare/biotech, real estate, industrials, new energy/EV

### Singapore: Southeast Asia and Beyond

**Typical transactions:**
- M&A in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand (infrastructure, consumer, fintech)
- Capital markets transactions for Southeast Asian corporates
- Family-office-driven M&A (prominent in Singapore's ecosystem)
- India-linked transactions (many Indian companies use Singapore as a listing/holding hub)
- Middle East sovereign wealth fund investments

**Sectors that dominate:** Technology/fintech, infrastructure, consumer/retail, real estate, energy transition

### Taiwan: A Growing Niche

Taiwan has a smaller but active IB market, primarily driven by:
- Semiconductor and technology M&A (TSMC ecosystem)
- Cross-strait transactions
- Local IPOs on TWSE/TPEx
- Private equity activity in tech manufacturing

Major banks with Taipei operations include Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citi, and Nomura. Mandarin fluency is essential. A Taiwan Brokerage License is preferred for some roles.

## Interview Differences in Asia

The core technical questions are the same globally—you still need to know how to [walk through a DCF](/blog/walk-me-through-dcf-perfect-answer), explain [how the three financial statements link](/blog/how-three-financial-statements-linked), and understand [enterprise value vs. equity value](/blog/enterprise-value-vs-equity-value-explained).

But Asia interviews add some wrinkles:

**1. Market knowledge is regionally specific.**
Don't discuss US deals if you're interviewing for Hong Kong IBD. Know the top 3-5 recent transactions in the Asia-Pacific region. Follow the South China Morning Post, Nikkei Asia, or The Business Times.

**2. Assessment centers test collaboration, not just individual brilliance.**
Group exercises—where you're given a case study to solve as a team while being observed—are common at Asia offices. Banks are evaluating how you contribute to group dynamics, not just whether you get the right answer.

**3. Language may be tested.**
Some banks will switch to Mandarin mid-interview to test fluency. Others include a written Mandarin component. If you've listed Mandarin on your resume, be prepared to prove it.

**4. "Why Asia?" is the equivalent of "Why banking?"**
If you're from the US or Europe, expect intense scrutiny on why you want to work in Asia. Generic answers ("Asia is the future of growth") won't cut it. Tie it to specific deals, personal connections, or long-term career goals rooted in the region.

**5. Cultural fit is assessed differently.**
Asian offices tend to value humility, team orientation, and respect for hierarchy more explicitly than US offices. This doesn't mean you should be passive—but calibrate your tone. Confidence without arrogance plays especially well.
