Middle-market banks get dismissed in compensation conversations. The assumption is that if you're not at Goldman or Evercore, you're leaving money on the table. That's partially true at the analyst level—but the gap is narrower than most people think, and the trade-offs in hours, deal experience, and quality of life make middle-market banks a compelling option.

Here's what middle-market investment bankers actually earn in 2026, sourced from Wall Street Oasis, Mergers & Inquisitions, Prospect Rock Partners, and Levels.fyi data.

> **Interviewing at a middle-market bank?** The technical questions are the same as bulge brackets—you still need to know [how the three financial statements link](/blog/how-three-financial-statements-linked) and [how to walk through a DCF](/blog/walk-me-through-dcf-perfect-answer). Our [Finance Technical Interview Guide](/playbooks/ib-technical-guide) has every question tagged by frequency.

## What Counts as "Middle Market"?

The middle-market category is broad. It includes:

**Upper Middle Market (competing with BBs on some deals):**
- Jefferies, Houlihan Lokey, Guggenheim Securities

**Core Middle Market:**
- William Blair, Piper Sandler, Baird, Raymond James

**Lower Middle Market:**
- Lincoln International, Stifel, Truist, Harris Williams

**Key distinction:** Middle-market banks focus on transactions typically valued between $50M and $2B (though upper MM firms increasingly win $5B+ deals). Bulge brackets and elite boutiques focus on $1B+ transactions. The deal size affects fees, which affects the bonus pool.

## Compensation by Level: Middle Market Overview

| Level | Base Salary | Bonus Range | Total Comp | vs. Bulge Bracket |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Analyst 1** | $100,000-$110,000 | $40,000-$80,000 | $140,000-$190,000 | -10 to -20% |
| **Analyst 2** | $110,000-$120,000 | $55,000-$100,000 | $165,000-$220,000 | -10 to -15% |
| **Analyst 3** | $120,000-$130,000 | $70,000-$130,000 | $190,000-$260,000 | -10 to -15% |
| **Associate 1** | $150,000-$175,000 | $80,000-$150,000 | $230,000-$325,000 | -10 to -20% |
| **Associate 2** | $175,000-$200,000 | $100,000-$200,000 | $275,000-$400,000 | -10 to -15% |
| **VP** | $225,000-$275,000 | $150,000-$350,000 | $375,000-$625,000 | -10 to -15% |
| **MD** | $300,000-$500,000 | $300,000-$1,500,000+ | $600,000-$2,000,000+ | -15 to -25% |

**Key trend:** Prospect Rock's 2024 data shows middle-market bonus growth of +5.0% median—lower than elite boutiques (+6.5%) and bulge brackets (+5.8%), but still positive. The middle-market compensation floor has risen steadily since 2020.

## Bank-by-Bank Breakdown

### Jefferies

**The verdict:** The de facto bridge between middle market and bulge bracket. Jefferies pays the most of any middle-market bank—sometimes matching or exceeding the lower bulge brackets.

**2026 Analyst Compensation:**

| Level | Base | Estimated Bonus | Estimated Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analyst 1 | $110,000 | $50,000-$90,000 | $160,000-$200,000 |
| Analyst 2 | $120,000 | $65,000-$115,000 | $185,000-$235,000 |
| Analyst 3 | $130,000 | $80,000-$140,000 | $210,000-$270,000 |

**What makes Jefferies different:**
- Levels.fyi data shows average total comp of $128K-$160K+ for analysts, though this may undercount bonuses
- Jefferies has grown aggressively in M&A and leveraged finance, increasingly competing with BBs for mandates
- The firm has a strong healthcare and technology franchise, where deal flow has been particularly robust
- Culture is entrepreneurial—less bureaucratic than BBs, more scrappy
- Analyst classes have grown significantly—Jefferies now recruits at target and semi-target schools
- Some groups (Healthcare, Tech, Lev Fin) consistently pay above the firm average

**Exit opportunities:** Jefferies analysts place well into PE, particularly upper-middle-market and growth equity funds. The brand has strengthened significantly in the past 5 years and is no longer viewed as a discount option.

### Houlihan Lokey

**The verdict:** The undisputed #1 middle-market bank by reputation, with a restructuring franchise that rivals the elite boutiques. Compensation reflects this dominance.

**2026 Analyst Compensation:**

| Level | Base | Estimated Bonus | Estimated Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analyst 1 | $110,000 | $50,000-$85,000 | $160,000-$195,000 |
| Analyst 2 | $120,000 | $60,000-$105,000 | $180,000-$225,000 |
| Analyst 3 | $130,000 | $75,000-$130,000 | $205,000-$260,000 |

**What makes Houlihan Lokey different:**
- #1 M&A advisor globally by deal count (consistently closes more transactions than any other bank)
- Dominant restructuring practice—among the best in the world alongside Lazard and PJT
- Financial and Valuation Advisory (FVA) group provides additional career tracks
- LA-headquartered (not NYC-centric)—significant presence in California, which offers lifestyle advantages
- More predictable hours than elite boutiques—analysts report 65-80 hour weeks on average
- Strong institutional knowledge in financial sponsors coverage

**Restructuring premium:** Houlihan Lokey's restructuring analysts can see above-average bonuses during periods of credit stress. When companies are distressed, Houlihan's Rx group is extremely busy—and the bonuses reflect it.

**Exit opportunities:** HLHZ is a strong PE feeder, particularly for middle-market and distressed/special situations funds. The restructuring background is highly valued.

### William Blair

**The verdict:** A Chicago-based middle-market bank with a strong culture, loyal alumni network, and competitive compensation for its tier.

**2026 Analyst Compensation:**

| Level | Base | Estimated Bonus | Estimated Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analyst 1 | $100,000-$105,000 | $40,000-$70,000 | $140,000-$175,000 |
| Analyst 2 | $110,000-$115,000 | $50,000-$85,000 | $160,000-$200,000 |
| Analyst 3 | $120,000-$125,000 | $60,000-$110,000 | $180,000-$235,000 |

**What makes William Blair different:**
- Chicago headquarters means lower cost of living than NYC-based peers
- Strong coverage in consumer, healthcare, and technology sectors
- Known for a "nicer" culture—less aggressive than NYC-centric banks
- Excellent analyst retention—many analysts choose to stay for the associate promote
- Growth equity advisory is a differentiator—not just M&A, but also PE fundraising advisory

**The Chicago advantage:** A William Blair analyst earning $160K total comp in Chicago has roughly equivalent purchasing power to a Goldman analyst earning $200K+ in Manhattan. Lower rent, lower taxes (no city income tax), and lower cost of living make the numbers more comparable than they appear.

### Piper Sandler

**The verdict:** A strong sector-focused middle-market bank with particular strength in healthcare, financial services, and technology. Compensation is competitive within the middle-market tier.

**2026 Analyst Compensation:**

| Level | Base | Estimated Bonus | Estimated Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analyst 1 | $100,000-$105,000 | $35,000-$65,000 | $135,000-$170,000 |
| Analyst 2 | $110,000-$115,000 | $50,000-$80,000 | $160,000-$195,000 |
| Analyst 3 | $120,000-$125,000 | $60,000-$105,000 | $180,000-$230,000 |

**What makes Piper Sandler different:**
- Formed from the merger of Piper Jaffray and Sandler O'Neill—combining healthcare/tech expertise with financial institutions coverage
- Minneapolis headquarters with significant NYC presence
- Healthcare group is one of the most active in the middle market
- Financial institutions group (legacy Sandler) is best-in-class for bank M&A
- More regional feel than NYC-centric banks—different cultural experience

## The Real Math: Middle Market vs. Bulge Bracket

The headline salary gap between middle market and bulge bracket is 10-20%. But compensation isn't just about the number on your paycheck:

### Hours-Adjusted Compensation

| Bank Type | AN1 Total Comp | Avg Hours/Week | Effective Hourly Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elite Boutique | $230,000 | 85-95 | $46-$52/hr |
| Bulge Bracket | $195,000 | 80-90 | $42-$47/hr |
| Upper Middle Market | $175,000 | 70-80 | $42-$48/hr |
| Core Middle Market | $155,000 | 65-75 | $40-$46/hr |

**The surprise:** On an hourly basis, middle-market banks are often competitive with or superior to bulge brackets. You may earn $20,000-$40,000 less per year, but you may also work 10-15 fewer hours per week. That's the equivalent of getting back 500-750 hours of your life annually.

### Cost-of-Living Adjustment

Many middle-market banks are headquartered outside of Manhattan:
- **Chicago** (William Blair, Lincoln): ~30% lower rent than NYC
- **Minneapolis** (Piper Sandler): ~40% lower
- **Milwaukee** (Baird): ~45% lower
- **Richmond** (Harris Williams): ~50% lower
- **St. Louis** (Stifel): ~55% lower

After adjusting for cost of living, a William Blair analyst in Chicago earning $160K has similar purchasing power to a JPMorgan analyst in NYC earning $200K+.

## Exit Opportunities from Middle-Market Banks

The biggest concern candidates have about middle-market banks is exit opportunities. Here's the reality:

**PE exits:** Middle-market banking exits into middle-market PE, which is a massive and growing universe:
- Upper MM PE (Audax, GTCR, Thoma Bravo, Madison Dearborn)
- Core MM PE (hundreds of funds in the $500M-$3B range)
- Growth equity (Insight Partners, Summit Partners, TA Associates)
- Sector-specific funds that value your coverage expertise

**What you won't get:** Direct exits to megafund PE (KKR, Blackstone, Apollo) are rare from core middle-market banks. Upper MM banks like Jefferies and HLHZ have better megafund placement than the core MM banks.

**What you will get:** More deal reps, earlier responsibility, and deep sector expertise. Middle-market analysts often close 5-10+ transactions per year versus 1-3 at a bulge bracket. Some PE firms actually prefer this—more deal experience per year of work.

**Alternative exits:** Corporate development, venture capital, growth equity, family offices, and industry roles are all accessible from middle-market banks.

For context on [boutique banks as stepping stones](/blog/boutique-banks-stepping-stone-bulge-bracket), many bankers use middle-market experience to lateral into larger banks or buy-side roles.

## Who Should Target Middle-Market Banks?

**Middle market is ideal if:**
- You prioritize work-life balance (by banking standards) over maximum compensation
- You want more deal reps and hands-on experience earlier in your career
- You're interested in middle-market PE or growth equity exits (which are excellent careers)
- You're at a semi-target or non-target school where MM banks recruit more actively
- You want to live outside of NYC—Chicago, LA, Minneapolis, and other cities offer great quality of life
- You're open to a [stepping stone](/blog/boutique-banks-stepping-stone-bulge-bracket) strategy toward larger banks

**Middle market may not be ideal if:**
- Megafund PE is your top exit goal (target BBs or EBs instead)
- You want to work on the largest, most complex transactions
- Maximum first-year compensation is your primary decision factor
- You want the strongest brand recognition for future career moves

3. **Hours-adjusted compensation** is often competitive with or better than bulge brackets
