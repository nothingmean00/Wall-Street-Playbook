PE compensation is notoriously opaque. Funds don't publish numbers. Associates don't talk specifics. The result is a lot of speculation and outdated data floating around forums.

This breakdown uses 2025-2026 data from industry sources and practitioner surveys to show what PE professionals actually earn—by level, fund type, and component.

## All-In Compensation by Level (2025-2026)

| Level | Megafund | Upper-MM | Middle-Market | Lower-MM |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|----------|
| Associate 1 | $325-400K | $275-350K | $225-300K | $175-250K |
| Associate 2 | $375-450K | $325-400K | $275-350K | $225-300K |
| Senior Associate | $425-525K | $375-475K | $325-425K | $275-375K |
| Vice President | $500-700K | $450-600K | $400-550K | $350-475K |
| Principal | $700K-1.2M | $600K-1M | $500-850K | $400-700K |
| Partner | $1.5M-5M+ | $1M-3M+ | $800K-2M+ | $600K-1.5M+ |

**Important note:** Partner compensation can reach $10M+ at top-performing megafunds due to carried interest realizations. The base + bonus component becomes less relevant as carry dominates total compensation.

## Understanding the Four Components

PE compensation isn't just "salary plus bonus." Understanding all four components helps you evaluate offers properly.

### 1. Base Salary

Fixed compensation paid bi-weekly. The most predictable component.

- **Associate level:** $150K-$200K base
- **VP level:** $250K-$350K base  
- **Partner level:** $400K-$600K base

Base increases predictably with tenure. It's the smallest relative component as you advance.

### 2. Annual Bonus

Performance-based, paid annually (typically Q1 of the following year).

**At Associate level:**
- Megafunds: 100-150% of base
- Middle-market: 75-125% of base

**What determines your bonus:**
- Individual performance and reviews
- Fund performance (deployment pace, markups)
- Firm economics and culture

Bonus is where significant variation occurs. A strong performer at a firm with a good year can meaningfully outpace peers.

### 3. Co-Investment

The opportunity to invest personal capital alongside the fund, typically on a no-fee/no-carry basis.

**Key details:**
- Usually available starting at Associate level
- Investment amounts scale with seniority
- Returns mirror fund performance without the 2/20 drag
- Requires personal capital (not all Associates can fully participate)

Co-invest lets you participate in deal economics immediately rather than waiting for carry to vest. It's particularly valuable at well-performing funds.

### 4. Carried Interest

The real wealth-builder in PE. Carry is your share of fund profits above the preferred return hurdle (typically 8%).

**Standard structure:**
- 20% of profits go to the GP (the fund)
- That 20% is allocated among the investment team
- Vests over 4-6 years
- Realized when deals exit and fund returns exceed the hurdle

**Carry typically doesn't become meaningful until VP level.** Associates at most funds receive little to no carry allocation.

## When Carry Starts to Matter

| Level | Typical Carry Points | Example Carry Value* |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Associate | 0 (rare exceptions) | $0 |
| Senior Associate | 0-0.1% | $0-$200K per fund |
| Vice President | 0.1-0.5% | $200K-$1M per fund |
| Principal | 0.5-1.5% | $1M-$3M per fund |
| Partner | 2-10%+ | $4M-$20M+ per fund |

*Assuming $2B fund with 2.0x gross MOIC over fund life

### Carry Economics Example

**Fund:** $2B  
**Performance:** 2.5x gross MOIC (= $5B exit value)  
**Gross profit:** $3B  
**Carried interest pool (20%):** $600M

**Allocation examples:**
- Partner with 5 points: **$30M** over fund life (6-10 years)
- Principal with 1 point: **$6M** over fund life
- VP with 0.25 points: **$1.5M** over fund life

This is why partners at successful megafunds can earn $10M+ annually once funds start exiting. A single fund's carry can exceed a decade of investment banking compensation.

## Geographic Compensation Variation

Location matters. Here's how comp varies by market:

| Market | Comp vs. NYC | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| NYC/SF | Baseline (+20-25% vs. other finance) | Highest competition, deepest deal flow |
| Boston | 90-95% of NYC | Strong healthcare/services focus |
| Chicago | ~Baseline | Industrials strength |
| LA | 95-100% of NYC | Consumer/media focus |
| Dallas/Houston | 85-95% of NYC | Energy/industrials, no state income tax |
| Miami | ~Baseline | Growing LatAm focus, no state income tax |

**Geographic arbitrage opportunity:** Texas and Miami offer competitive compensation with significantly lower taxes (no state income tax) and cost of living. A $350K package in Miami has higher purchasing power than $400K in NYC.

## The Megafund Compensation Leaders

Based on 2024-2025 practitioner data, these firms consistently lead on compensation:

**Apollo Global Management:** Industry-leading Associate comp at $400-450K+ all-in. Known for intense culture but top-of-market pay.

**KKR:** $350-400K+ all-in for Associates. Strong operational focus through Capstone consulting team.

**Hellman & Friedman:** $350-400K+ all-in. Lean teams, concentrated portfolios, SF-based.

**Blackstone:** $350-400K+ all-in. Largest brand, most institutionalized experience.

**TPG:** $350-400K+ all-in. West Coast roots with strong tech/healthcare exposure.

The differences between megafunds at Associate level are relatively small (maybe $30-50K all-in). The bigger differences emerge in culture, deal exposure, and promotion likelihood.

## What Actually Matters Beyond Year 1 Comp

Candidates often over-optimize for Year 1 compensation. Here's what matters more:

**Promotion rates:** Middle-market funds promote 2-3x more frequently than megafunds. A $50K Year 1 premium means nothing if you're pushed out after two years.

**Learning breadth:** Smaller funds often provide broader deal exposure—you see entire transactions rather than one workstream. This compounds over a career.

**Carry trajectory:** A VP at a $500M fund with 0.5% carry may outpace a VP at a $5B fund with 0.1% carry if the smaller fund performs better.

**Exit options:** Both megafund and MM experience open doors. The "megafund or bust" mentality ignores that corp dev, portfolio company roles, and even hedge funds value MM experience.

## Career Progression and Realistic Timelines

| Transition | Duration | Conversion Rate |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Associate → Senior Associate | 2-3 years | ~70% |
| Senior Associate → VP | 1-2 years | ~60% |
| VP → Principal | 2-4 years | ~50% |
| Principal → Partner | 3-5 years | ~30-40% |

**Total time from Associate to Partner:** 15-20 years  
**Only ~5-10% of Associates who start ultimately make Partner**

The PE career path is a tournament. Most people exit before reaching the top—and that's not failure. Portfolio company CFO roles, corporate development leadership, and hedge fund positions are common and lucrative exits.

## The Bottom Line

PE compensation is exceptional, but the real wealth comes from carry—not salary. A Partner's carry from a single successful fund can exceed a decade of investment banking compensation.

For Associate-level candidates, the compensation differences between fund types are meaningful but not life-changing. The bigger questions are: Where will you learn the most? Where will you have the best promotion prospects? Where does the culture fit?

Those factors compound over a 15-20 year career far more than a $30K Year 1 difference.
