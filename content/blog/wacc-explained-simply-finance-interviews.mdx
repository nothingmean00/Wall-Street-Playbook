WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) is the discount rate used in DCF analysis. It represents the blended rate of return that all of a company's capital providers—debt holders and equity holders—require.

Every DCF question eventually leads to WACC. Here's how to explain it clearly and handle the follow-ups.

## The Formula

**WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1 - T))**

| Component | What It Is |
|-----------|-----------|
| E/V | Equity weight (% of total capital from equity) |
| D/V | Debt weight (% of total capital from debt) |
| Re | Cost of equity |
| Rd | Cost of debt |
| T | Marginal tax rate |
| V | E + D (total capital) |

**The intuition:** A company is funded by some mix of debt and equity. Each has a cost. WACC blends these costs based on how much of each the company uses.

## Breaking Down Each Component

### Cost of Equity (Re) — The CAPM Model

**Re = Rf + β × (Rm - Rf)**

| Component | What It Is | Typical Value |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Rf | Risk-free rate (10-year Treasury yield) | 4-5% in 2026 |
| β (Beta) | Stock's sensitivity to market movements | 0.8-1.5 for most companies |
| Rm - Rf | Equity risk premium (ERP) | 5-7% |

**Risk-free rate:** Use the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. This is the return an investor can earn with zero risk—it's the baseline.

**Beta:** Measures how volatile a stock is relative to the market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock moves with the market. Above 1.0 means more volatile (higher risk, higher required return). Below 1.0 means less volatile.

- **Tech companies:** Often β > 1.0 (more volatile)
- **Utilities:** Often β < 1.0 (stable, defensive)

**Equity risk premium:** The extra return investors demand for holding risky stocks instead of risk-free bonds. This is estimated from historical market data (S&P 500 average return minus risk-free rate).

**Example:** Rf = 4.5%, β = 1.2, ERP = 6%

Re = 4.5% + 1.2 × 6% = **11.7%**

> **INTERVIEWER PERSPECTIVE:** When a candidate can explain *why* each CAPM component exists (compensation for time value, systematic risk, and market risk), it signals genuine understanding vs. formula memorization.

### Cost of Debt (Rd)

**Rd = Yield to Maturity on the Company's Debt**

In practice, you can use:
- The yield on the company's publicly traded bonds
- The company's interest expense ÷ total debt (blended rate)
- The risk-free rate + default spread based on credit rating

**The (1-T) adjustment:** Interest on debt is tax-deductible. A company paying 6% interest at a 25% tax rate has an after-tax cost of debt of 6% × (1 - 0.25) = **4.5%**. This tax shield is why debt is "cheaper" than equity—and why the Modigliani-Miller theorem suggests adding debt can increase firm value (up to a point).

### Capital Structure Weights

**Use market values, not book values.**

- E = Market cap (share price × diluted shares)
- D = Market value of debt (or book value as a proxy if market isn't available)
- V = E + D

**Why market values?** Because WACC represents the *current* cost of capital. Book values reflect historical costs. If a company's stock has doubled, its equity weight has increased—using book values would understate the equity weight.

**Common follow-up:** *"Should you use the company's current capital structure or a target structure?"*

Use the **target capital structure** if the company is expected to change its leverage (e.g., an LBO where leverage will decrease over time). Otherwise, use the current structure.

## Interview Questions About WACC

### "What happens to WACC if you add more debt?"

Initially, WACC decreases because debt is cheaper than equity (tax shield). But beyond a point, both the cost of debt and cost of equity increase because:
- Lenders charge higher rates for riskier companies (more debt = more default risk)
- Equity holders demand higher returns for the increased risk of being wiped out in bankruptcy

This creates a **U-shaped curve** with an optimal capital structure at the bottom.

### "Why is cost of equity higher than cost of debt?"

Two reasons:
1. **Tax deductibility** — Interest is tax-deductible, dividends aren't
2. **Priority of claims** — Debt holders get paid first in bankruptcy. Equity holders bear more risk and therefore demand higher returns

### "If a company has no debt, what is WACC?"

**WACC = Cost of equity.** With no debt, the entire capital structure is equity. The formula simplifies to WACC = Re.

### "How does beta change with leverage?"

Higher leverage increases beta. This is because equity holders bear more risk when there's more debt—their returns are more sensitive to changes in the company's operating performance.

**Levered Beta = Unlevered Beta × [1 + (1-T) × (D/E)]**

Unlevered beta reflects pure business risk. Levered beta adds financial risk from the capital structure. When comparing betas across companies with different leverage, you "unlever" their betas first, then "re-lever" at the target company's capital structure.

### "What discount rate would you use for a very risky project?"

You wouldn't necessarily use the company's WACC. If a specific project has different risk than the overall company, use a **project-specific discount rate**. For example, if a stable consumer goods company invests in a risky tech venture, the company's low WACC would understate the project's risk.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using book values for weights** — Always use market values
2. **Forgetting the tax shield** — The (1-T) on debt cost is essential
3. **Using the wrong beta** — Use levered beta that matches the target capital structure
4. **Assuming WACC is constant** — For LBOs where leverage changes significantly over the hold period, WACC changes year by year (which is why LBOs typically use levered FCF and cost of equity instead)
5. **Confusing nominal and real rates** — If your cash flows are nominal, WACC must be nominal too

## WACC in Context: Why It Matters

WACC isn't just an interview concept—it's the core of corporate finance decision-making:

- **Investment decisions:** A project should only be pursued if its expected return exceeds WACC
- **Valuation:** WACC is the discount rate in DCF, directly determining what the company is "worth"
- **Capital allocation:** Understanding WACC helps companies decide how to fund growth (debt vs. equity)

When you explain WACC in an interview, show that you understand it as a decision-making tool, not just a formula to plug into a DCF.
