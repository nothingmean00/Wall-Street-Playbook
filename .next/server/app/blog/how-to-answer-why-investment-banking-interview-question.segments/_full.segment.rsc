"Why investment banking?" is asked in virtually every IB interview.

A specific experience or moment that triggered your interest. This grounds your answer in reality.</h3><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Part 2: The Confirmation (How You Tested It)
What you did to explore and validate that interest. This shows intentionality.</h3><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Part 3: The Fit (Why IB Specifically)
What about investment banking—as opposed to consulting, corporate finance, or other paths—makes it the right fit.</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Total length:</strong> 60-90 seconds. Don't ramble.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What TO Say</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Mention these elements:</strong>
- Exposure to deals, transactions, or M&A that sparked interest
- Specific aspects of IB that appeal: deal execution, client advisory, financial analysis
- Evidence of testing your interest (internships, projects, coursework)
- Intellectual curiosity about how deals work
- Desire for steep learning curve and high-intensity environment</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Good motivations:</strong>
- "I want to understand how businesses are valued and transactions are structured"
- "I thrive in fast-paced environments with high stakes"
- "I want to build technical skills that compound over a career"
- "I'm drawn to working on consequential projects that shape industries"</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What NOT to Say</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Never mention:</strong>
- "Exit opportunities" (Everyone knows you want to leave for PE—don't say it)
- "Money" (Obvious and makes you seem mercenary)
- "Prestige" (Shallow and signals you don't understand the work)
- "I want to do deals" (Vague—what do you think deals involve?)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Avoid these framings:</strong>
- "I've always wanted to work on Wall Street" (Why? Be specific)
- "I love finance and numbers" (So do accountants)
- "I want to help companies grow" (You could do that in consulting or corporate)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Example Answers by Background</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">For a Target School Junior</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"My interest in investment banking started sophomore year when I joined the Investment Banking Club and worked on a stock pitch competition. Breaking down a company's financials and thinking through its valuation got me hooked on the analytical process.
Last summer, I interned at [Bank/Firm] where I worked on pitch materials for a potential acquisition. Seeing how the team structured the analysis and advised the client confirmed that I want to be on the deal side—not just analyzing companies theoretically, but working on live transactions with real stakes.
What draws me specifically to banking over other paths is the combination of technical depth and client exposure. I want to build those modeling and valuation skills while also learning how to advise executives on critical decisions."</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">For a Non-Target with Limited Finance Experience</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"I became interested in investment banking through an unexpected path. I was working on a financial analysis project in my accounting class, and I started reading about how the company we analyzed had just been acquired. I went down a rabbit hole learning about the deal—the valuation, the strategic rationale, the process—and realized this was the type of work I wanted to do.
Since then, I've focused on building relevant skills: I completed Wall Street Prep's financial modeling program, joined our finance club, and completed an internship in corporate finance where I worked on budgeting and some basic valuation work.
Those experiences confirmed my interest, but I want to work on larger, more complex transactions. Investment banking offers the opportunity to build those skills quickly while working on deals that actually move markets."</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">For a Career Changer / Lateral</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"I came to investment banking from [Previous Industry], where I was doing [Role]. While I enjoyed [aspect], I found myself increasingly drawn to the financial and strategic aspects of decisions.
Last year, I had the opportunity to work closely with our investment bankers during a financing round, and I saw firsthand how they structured the process and advised our leadership. That experience crystallized something I'd been thinking about: I want to be the advisor in the room, not just the operator.
I know the transition is challenging, but my background gives me sector knowledge in [Industry], and I've spent the past [X months] building the technical foundation through [coursework/certifications]. Banking is the right path because it combines analytical rigor with strategic advisory work in a way that other roles don't."</blockquote><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Common Follow-Up Questions</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">"Why not consulting?"</strong>
> "I considered it, but I'm more interested in financial analysis and transaction execution than operational strategy. Banking offers deeper exposure to valuation, capital markets, and deal structuring."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">"Why not private equity directly?"</strong>
> "I want to build the technical foundation first. Banking provides the modeling skills and deal exposure that make someone effective in investing roles. I believe in earning that foundation."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">"What if you hate the hours?"</strong>
