"What's the difference between enterprise value and equity value?"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This question appears in virtually every IB, PE, and hedge fund interview. It sounds simple, but most candidates either give a textbook definition that lacks intuition or make subtle errors that reveal they don't truly understand the concept.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's how to nail it—and the follow-ups that separate offers from dings.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The House Analogy (30-Second Answer)</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Think of a house worth $500K with a $300K mortgage.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Enterprise value</strong> is the total price of the house: <strong class="text-charcoal">$500K</strong></li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Equity value</strong> is what the homeowner actually owns: <strong class="text-charcoal">$200K</strong> ($500K - $300K)</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Similarly for a company:
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Enterprise value</strong> = value of the entire business to ALL capital providers (debt + equity holders)
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Equity value</strong> = value available only to equity holders (shareholders)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The formula connecting them:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Enterprise Value = Equity Value + Net Debt</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Where Net Debt = Total Debt + Preferred Stock + Minority Interest - Cash</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Why This Distinction Matters</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This isn't academic trivia. Getting EV vs. equity value wrong will cause you to:</p><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Use the wrong valuation multiples</strong> — EV/EBITDA uses enterprise value because EBITDA is pre-debt (available to all capital providers). P/E uses equity value because earnings are post-debt (available only to equity holders).</li></ol><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Misvalue companies in M&A</strong> — When you acquire a company, you pay the equity value to shareholders, but you assume the debt. The total "cost" is the enterprise value.</li></ol><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Make incorrect comparisons</strong> — Two companies with identical operations but different capital structures will have different equity values but similar enterprise values. EV-based multiples remove the noise of capital structure.</li></ol><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The EV Bridge: Walking Through Each Component</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Starting Point: Equity Value (Market Cap)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Equity Value = Share Price × Diluted Shares Outstanding</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Use diluted shares, not basic shares. This accounts for stock options and convertible securities that could increase the share count.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">+ Total Debt</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">All interest-bearing obligations: bank loans, bonds, capital leases, and any other debt. This represents the claims of debt holders on the business.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why add debt?</strong> Because enterprise value represents the value of the business to all capital providers. If you're buying the whole house, you need to account for the mortgage.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">+ Preferred Stock</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Preferred stock behaves more like debt than equity—it typically has fixed dividend payments and priority over common equity. It's a claim on the business that sits above common shareholders.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">+ Minority Interest</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If a company consolidates a subsidiary it doesn't fully own (e.g., owns 80%), the full subsidiary revenue and EBITDA appear in the financials. Adding minority interest accounts for the portion owned by outside shareholders.</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">RED FLAG:</strong> Many candidates forget minority interest. If you're including 100% of a subsidiary's EBITDA in your EV/EBITDA multiple, you must include 100% of its value in EV—which means adding minority interest.</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">− Cash and Cash Equivalents</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Cash is subtracted because it effectively reduces the net cost of acquiring the business. If you buy a company for $500M that has $100M in cash, your net cost is really $400M—you can use that cash to pay down the acquisition price or debt.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Diluted Shares: The Treasury Stock Method</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is a common follow-up. When calculating diluted shares, you use the <strong class="text-charcoal">treasury stock method (TSM)</strong> for options and warrants:</p><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80">Assume all in-the-money options are exercised</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">The company receives exercise price × number of options (proceeds)</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">These proceeds "buy back" shares at the current market price</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Net dilution = options exercised - shares bought back</li></ol><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Example:</strong> 10M basic shares. 1M options with $20 strike price. Current stock price: $50.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80">Proceeds from exercise: 1M × $20 = $20M</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Shares bought back: $20M ÷ $50 = 400K</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Net new shares: 1M - 400K = 600K</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Diluted shares: 10.6M</strong></li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Key rule:</strong> Only <em>in-the-money</em> options (strike price < current share price) are included. Out-of-the-money options wouldn't rationally be exercised.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Matching Principle: Why This Gets Candidates Dinged</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The single most important rule in valuation multiples:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The numerator and denominator must be consistent.</strong></p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Enterprise value multiples</strong> use metrics available to ALL capital providers:</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">  - EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">  - These metrics are <em>pre-debt</em>—they're calculated before interest expense</li></ul><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Equity value multiples</strong> use metrics available only to EQUITY holders:</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">  - P/E (Price/Earnings), P/BV (Price/Book Value)</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">  - These metrics are <em>post-debt</em>—they're calculated after interest expense</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The trap:</strong> An interviewer might ask, "Would you ever use EV/Net Income?" The answer is <strong class="text-charcoal">no</strong>—net income is after interest expense (a payment to debt holders), so it's an equity metric. Using it with EV would mismatch the claims.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Similarly, "Would you use Price/EBITDA?" No—EBITDA is pre-debt, so it should pair with EV, not equity value.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Common Interview Questions</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"When would equity value be greater than enterprise value?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">When a company has <strong class="text-charcoal">more cash than debt</strong> (net cash position). Enterprise Value = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. If Cash > Debt, EV < Equity Value.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Example: Apple at various points has held more cash than debt, making its EV lower than its market cap.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Can enterprise value be negative?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Technically yes, if a company's cash balance exceeds its equity value plus debt. This is rare and usually indicates the market believes the company will burn through its cash (the business operations are worth less than zero).</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Why do we use EV/EBITDA instead of P/E for most valuation work?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Three reasons:
1. <strong class="text-charcoal">Capital structure neutral</strong> — EV/EBITDA isn't affected by how a company is financed. Two identical businesses with different leverage will have different P/E ratios but similar EV/EBITDA.
2. <strong class="text-charcoal">D&A neutral</strong> — EBITDA strips out depreciation differences, making it better for comparing capital-intensive vs. asset-light businesses.
3. <strong class="text-charcoal">Tax neutral</strong> — Different tax structures don't distort the comparison.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Walk me through an EV bridge for Company X."</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Start with market cap (share price × diluted shares). Add total debt from the balance sheet. Add preferred stock and minority interest if applicable. Subtract cash and equivalents.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Pro tip:</strong> Always use the <em>most recent</em> balance sheet data, not annual data that may be months old.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Quick Reference: EV vs. Equity Value</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">| Metric | Value Type | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Revenue | Enterprise | Pre-debt, available to all |
| EBITDA | Enterprise | Pre-debt, pre-D&A |
| EBIT | Enterprise | Pre-debt |
| Net Income | Equity | Post-debt (after interest) |
| EPS | Equity | Post-debt, per-share |
