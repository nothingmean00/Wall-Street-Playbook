"Walk me through your resume" is the first question in virtually every investment banking interview. It sets the tone for everything that follows. Most candidates ramble, give too much detail, or fail to tell a coherent story.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's how to nail it.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Why This Question Matters So Much</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The "walk me through your resume" question accomplishes several things for the interviewer:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">It tests communication skills.</strong> Can you structure thoughts clearly and present them concisely? IB is client-facing—you'll need to present to executives and boards.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">It reveals self-awareness.</strong> Do you understand your own story? Can you articulate what drives you?</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">It shows preparation.</strong> A polished answer signals someone who takes things seriously. A rambling answer signals someone who didn't prepare.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">It frames the entire interview.</strong> Your answer determines which follow-up questions you get. Control the narrative, and you control the interview.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Three-Part Structure</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Your answer should follow this framework: <strong class="text-charcoal">Past → Present → Future</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Past (30 seconds):</strong> Where you started and what sparked your interest</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Present (60-90 seconds):</strong> How you developed that interest and what you've done</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Future (30 seconds):</strong> Why investment banking is the logical next step</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Total time: 2-2.5 minutes maximum. Any longer and you've lost them.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Framework in Action</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Opening: The Hook</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Start with a brief origin that establishes context and hints at your trajectory.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Weak opening:</strong>
"I grew up in Ohio and went to State University where I majored in finance..."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Strong opening:</strong>
"My interest in finance started in high school when my father's company was acquired—I was fascinated by how the deal was structured and what drove the valuation."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The strong opening creates intrigue. It gives a reason for your interest that feels authentic, not generic.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Middle: The Development</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Walk through 2-3 experiences that show progression and relevance. Don't recite every line of your resume—highlight what matters.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Structure each experience:</strong>
1. What the role was (one sentence)
2. What you did that was relevant (one sentence)
3. What you learned or how it developed your interest (one sentence)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Example:</strong>
"That curiosity led me to pursue a finance major and join our school's investment club. Sophomore summer, I interned at a Big 4 firm in their transaction advisory group, where I worked on three sell-side due diligence projects. That experience confirmed I wanted to be closer to the deal itself—not just supporting it."</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Closing: The Future</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Connect your story to why you're sitting in this interview, at this firm, for this role.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Weak closing:</strong>
"So that's why I'm interested in investment banking."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Strong closing:</strong>
"Investment banking at [Firm] is the natural next step—I want to be at the center of transactions, advising companies through their most important decisions. And [Firm]'s strength in [sector/product] aligns directly with my interest in [specific area]."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The strong closing shows you've thought about fit, not just banking in general.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Full Example: Target School Student</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">"I first became interested in finance during a high school economics class where we ran a mock stock portfolio. That led me to pursue economics at Penn, where I joined the Wharton Undergraduate Finance Club.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Freshman summer, I interned at a regional bank in their commercial lending group. I got exposure to credit analysis and saw how capital enables business growth. Sophomore year, I took on leadership in the finance club and organized a speaker series with alumni in banking.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This past summer, I interned at a boutique M&A advisory firm, where I worked on two live sell-side mandates. I built CIMs, ran comparable analyses, and joined client calls. The experience solidified that M&A advisory is what I want to do.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Goldman's M&A group is where I want to be—the deal flow, the caliber of transactions, and the training are unmatched. I've spoken with three people in the group, and the culture of mentorship stands out."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why it works:</strong> Clear progression, specific experiences, genuine interest, and firm-specific close.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Full Example: Non-Target Student</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">"My path to finance wasn't traditional. I'm from a small town in Texas and went to Texas Tech, which doesn't have on-campus banking recruiting.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">I became interested in finance sophomore year when I took a corporate valuation course and realized I loved analyzing businesses. I cold-emailed 100+ alumni and professionals, eventually landing an internship at a middle-market PE fund where I built models and conducted due diligence on add-on acquisitions.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">That experience showed me I want to be on the advisory side—helping companies think through the most important transactions they'll ever make. I've worked hard to compensate for my school's lack of recruiting: I've completed the BIWS modeling courses, led our finance club to triple membership, and networked extensively with Jefferies professionals.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">I'm drawn to Jefferies specifically because of the entrepreneurial culture and the focus on middle-market sponsors—which aligns with my PE experience and where I see the most interesting deal activity."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why it works:</strong> Addresses the non-target directly, shows hustle and initiative, demonstrates why banking despite unconventional path.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Full Example: Career Changer</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">"I spent the first four years of my career in consulting at Deloitte, working primarily with financial services clients on operational and technology transformations.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">While the work was interesting, I found myself most engaged when projects touched on strategic transactions—a bank integration after a merger, a divestiture support engagement. I wanted to be closer to those decisions, not supporting them after the fact.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">To prepare for this transition, I completed a financial modeling certification, took additional coursework in valuation, and networked extensively with former consultants now in banking. I also earned my CFA Level 1.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">I'm targeting Evercore specifically because of the advisory-only model and reputation for senior banker involvement in execution. The healthcare group interests me given my consulting experience with healthcare clients."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why it works:</strong> Explains the transition logically, shows preparation for the change, connects previous experience to banking.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 1: Starting from Birth</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">"I was born in California, then my family moved to New Jersey when I was 7..."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Nobody cares about your childhood unless it directly relates to your interest in finance. Start where relevance begins.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 2: Reading Your Resume Line by Line</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The interviewer has your resume. Don't just recite it. Tell the story that connects the dots.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 3: Being Too Long</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If you're talking for more than 2.5 minutes, you've lost them. Practice until you hit the right length.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 4: Generic Motivation</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">"I want to work hard and learn a lot" describes every job. Be specific about what draws you to banking specifically.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 5: No Firm-Specific Close</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">"That's why I'm interested in investment banking" is weak. Close with why this firm, this group, this opportunity.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 6: Underselling Transferable Experience</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If you have non-traditional experience, connect it to banking skills. Consulting = client management, analytical rigor. Military = leadership, performing under pressure.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Handling Follow-Up Questions</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Your "walk me through your resume" answer should invite specific follow-ups you're prepared for.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">"Tell me more about your internship at [Firm]."</strong>
Be ready to go deeper on any experience you mentioned. Have specific stories, learnings, and examples.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">"Why did you choose [school/major/path]?"</strong>
Know your reasoning for every decision on your resume.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">"What did you learn from [experience]?"</strong>
Have a genuine takeaway—ideally one that connects to banking.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">"Why not stay in [current field]?"</strong>
For career changers, have a clear answer that's honest without bashing your current role.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Practice Protocol</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">You can't wing this question. Here's how to prepare:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Step 1:</strong> Write out your answer (aim for 250-350 words)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Step 2:</strong> Time yourself reading it. Adjust until you're at 2-2.5 minutes.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Step 3:</strong> Practice saying it aloud 20+ times until it's natural, not memorized-sounding.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Step 4:</strong> Record yourself. Watch for filler words, pacing, and confidence.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Step 5:</strong> Practice with someone else. Get feedback on clarity and engagement.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Step 6:</strong> Prepare variations. Sometimes they'll ask "tell me about yourself" or "why are you here?" Same structure, minor adjustments.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Mindset Shift</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Think of "walk me through your resume" not as a history lesson, but as an argument.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">You're arguing: "Here's why my background makes me an excellent fit for this role at this firm."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Every sentence should support that argument. Cut anything that doesn't.</p><hr class="my-10 border-gold/30" /><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><em>Need help crafting your story?
