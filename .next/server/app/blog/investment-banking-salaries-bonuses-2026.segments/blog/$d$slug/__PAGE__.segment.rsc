Investment banking remains one of the highest-paying entry-level careers in finance. But compensation varies significantly by bank, group, and performance. Here's what you can actually expect to earn in 2026.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">2026 Investment Banking Compensation Overview</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Analyst 1 (First Year):</strong>

- Bonus: $110,000 - $165,000
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Total Comp: $235,000 - $290,000</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Analyst 3 (Third Year, if applicable):</strong>
- Base Salary: $135,000
- Bonus: $125,000 - $185,000
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Total Comp: $260,000 - $320,000</strong></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Bulge Bracket vs. Elite Boutique Pay</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Bulge Brackets (Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, etc.):</strong>
Pay across bulge brackets has largely converged. Base salaries are standardized, and bonuses fall within predictable ranges based on performance and deal flow.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Elite Boutiques (Evercore, Centerview, PJT, Lazard, Moelis):</strong>
Elite boutiques often pay premiums—particularly in bonus. A top-performing analyst at Evercore or Centerview may earn 10-20% more than peers at bulge brackets.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Middle Market Banks:</strong>
Compensation is typically 10-20% lower than bulge brackets, but hours can be slightly more manageable, and training may be stronger in some groups.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What Drives Bonus Variation?</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Your bonus isn't random. Several factors determine where you fall in the range:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">1. Bank Performance</strong>
Did your bank have a strong year? Deal volume and fee revenue directly impact the bonus pool.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">2. Group Performance</strong>
Hot groups (tech M&A, healthcare, sponsors) often have larger bonus pools than slower groups.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">3. Individual Performance</strong>
Your review scores matter. Top-bucket analysts can earn 30-50% more in bonus than bottom-bucket peers.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">4. Market Conditions</strong>
M&A activity, IPO markets, and overall deal flow affect compensation industry-wide.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Associate Compensation (Post-MBA or Promoted)</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Associate 1:</strong>

- <strong class="text-charcoal">Total Comp: $1,000,000 - $3,000,000+</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">MD compensation is highly variable and tied to revenue generation. Top producers at major banks can earn $5M+.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Hours Reality Check</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Before focusing solely on compensation, consider the hours:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Analysts:</strong> 80-100 hours/week is common. Some weeks approach 100+.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Associates:</strong> 70-90 hours/week typically.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">VPs and above:</strong> 60-80 hours/week, but more client-facing stress.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Hourly rates, when calculated, often fall well below what you'd expect given total compensation.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">How 2026 Compares to Previous Years</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Compensation has risen significantly since 2020:
- 2020: Analyst 1 base was $85,000
- 2021: Base increased to $100,000
- 2022-2023: Base hit $110,000 (current level)
- 2024-2026: Bases have held steady; bonus variance reflects market conditions</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The 2021-2022 M&A boom drove both base increases and exceptional bonuses. The market has normalized, but compensation remains historically high.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Maximizing Your Compensation</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">1. Choose Your Bank Wisely</strong>
Elite boutiques and top bulge brackets consistently pay at or above market.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">2. Target Hot Groups</strong>
Technology, healthcare, and sponsors coverage tend to have more deal flow and larger bonus pools.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">3. Perform at a High Level</strong>
Reviews matter. Being in the top bucket can mean $30-50K more in annual bonus.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">4. Exit Strategically</strong>
PE and hedge fund exits typically come with significant pay bumps.
