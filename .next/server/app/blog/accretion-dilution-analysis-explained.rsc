M&A questions are where IB interviews get serious. The accounting, valuation, and accounting chapters are warm-ups—M&A is where interviewers test whether you can actually think about deals, not just memorize formulas.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The centerpiece of M&A interview questions is accretion/dilution analysis. Here's how it works, why it matters, and the questions you'll face.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What Is Accretion/Dilution?</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">When Company A acquires Company B, the combined entity has a new EPS. The fundamental question:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Is the acquirer's EPS higher (accretive) or lower (dilutive) after the deal?</strong></p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Accretive:</strong> Combined EPS > Acquirer's standalone EPS → shareholders benefit</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Dilutive:</strong> Combined EPS < Acquirer's standalone EPS → shareholders are worse off (at least initially)</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Accretion/dilution analysis tells you whether a deal creates or destroys per-share value for the acquirer's shareholders in Year 1.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The P/E Rule: The Quick Mental Math</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is the shortcut every banker uses for stock deals:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">In an all-stock deal, if the acquirer's P/E is higher than the target's P/E, the deal is accretive. If the acquirer's P/E is lower, the deal is dilutive.</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why this works:</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Think of P/E as the "price" of a dollar of earnings. If Company A trades at 20x P/E and buys Company B at 15x P/E, Company A is buying earnings "cheaply"—each dollar of B's earnings costs less than a dollar of A's earnings is valued by the market. The combined EPS increases.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Example:</strong>
- Company A: P/E 20x, EPS $2.00, 100M shares, Price $40
- Company B: P/E 12x, EPS $3.00, 50M shares, Price $36</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A buys B in all stock at market price. Exchange ratio = $36/$40 = 0.9x. A issues 0.9 × 50M = 45M new shares.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Combined:</strong>
- Combined earnings: ($2 × 100M) + ($3 × 50M) = $350M
- Combined shares: 100M + 45M = 145M
- Combined EPS: $350M / 145M = <strong class="text-charcoal">$2.41</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Acquirer's standalone EPS was $2.00 → Deal is <strong class="text-charcoal">accretive</strong> by $0.41.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This makes sense: A's P/E (20x) > B's P/E (12x).</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">What About Cash Deals?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">For all-cash deals, the test is different:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Is the yield on the target's earnings greater than the after-tax cost of debt (or the opportunity cost of the cash used)?</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If Company A uses cash to buy B, there's no share dilution. But A either:
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Borrows</strong> to fund the deal (cost = after-tax interest expense)
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Uses cash on hand</strong> (cost = lost interest income on that cash)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If the earnings gained from B exceed the financing cost, the deal is accretive.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Example:</strong> A buys B for $1.8B in cash, funded by debt at 5% pre-tax (4% after-tax). B earns $150M.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80">Earnings gained: $150M</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Cost of debt: $1.8B × 4% = $72M</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Net earnings impact: +$78M → <strong class="text-charcoal">Accretive</strong></li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Purchase Price Allocation & Goodwill</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">When Company A buys Company B, the target's assets and liabilities are "stepped up" to fair market value on A's balance sheet. This process is called <strong class="text-charcoal">purchase price allocation (PPA)</strong>.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Goodwill = Purchase Price - Fair Market Value of Net Identifiable Assets</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If A pays $500M for B, and B's net identifiable assets have a fair market value of $350M, goodwill = $150M.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Key interview points:</strong>
- Goodwill is <strong class="text-charcoal">not amortized</strong> under GAAP (it is under IFRS)
- Goodwill is <strong class="text-charcoal">tested for impairment</strong> annually
- If impaired, it's written down as a non-cash charge on the income statement
- The stepped-up asset values may result in higher depreciation, which affects post-deal earnings</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">RED FLAG:</strong> When candidates say "goodwill is the premium you pay," that's incomplete. Goodwill is specifically the excess OVER fair value of identifiable assets.

Assumes ALL assets and liabilities (including unknown ones).</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Asset deal:</strong> Buyer cherry-picks specific assets and assumes specific liabilities. The target entity continues to exist.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Tax implications:</strong>
- Sellers prefer stock deals (capital gains treatment on shares)
- Buyers prefer asset deals (step-up in tax basis of assets, reducing future tax through higher depreciation)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Merger Model: Key Interview Questions</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Walk me through a basic merger model."</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Step 1:</strong> Project both companies' standalone financials
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 2:</strong> Determine the offer price and deal structure (cash, stock, or mix)
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 3:</strong> Calculate purchase price allocation (goodwill, asset step-ups)
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 4:</strong> Calculate financing (new debt, foregone interest on cash used, new shares issued)
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 5:</strong> Combine the income statements, adding synergies and subtracting new costs
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 6:</strong> Calculate pro forma EPS and compare to the acquirer's standalone EPS → accretive or dilutive?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"What are synergies?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Cost synergies:</strong> Eliminating redundant costs (duplicate HQ, overlapping sales teams, shared IT infrastructure). Typically 5-10% of the smaller company's cost base. More predictable.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Revenue synergies:</strong> Cross-selling products, accessing new markets, pricing power. Harder to quantify and realize. Investors are more skeptical of revenue synergies.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"How do you account for synergies in a merger model?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Add synergies (net of implementation costs) to the combined income statement. They directly increase the combined earnings, making the deal more accretive.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Be careful:</strong> Don't double-count. Synergies should be incremental, not already embedded in each company's standalone projections.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"An acquirer pays a 30% premium. Is the deal accretive or dilutive?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">You can't tell from the premium alone.</strong> It depends on:
- Deal structure (stock vs. cash)
- Relative P/E multiples
- Financing costs
- Synergies</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A 30% premium with significant synergies could easily be accretive. The premium is what you pay; accretion/dilution is about what you get.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Summary Cheat Sheet</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| Accretive deal | Combined EPS > Acquirer standalone EPS |
| Dilutive deal | Combined EPS < Acquirer standalone EPS |
| P/E rule (stock deal) | Higher P/E buys lower P/E = accretive |
| Cash deal test | Earnings yield > after-tax cost of debt = accretive |
| Goodwill | Purchase price - FMV of net identifiable assets |
| Control premium | 20-40% above unaffected market price |
