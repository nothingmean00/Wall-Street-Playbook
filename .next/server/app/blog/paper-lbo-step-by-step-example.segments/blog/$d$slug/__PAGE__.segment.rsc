Leverage (Financial Engineering)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">More debt = less equity = higher percentage returns (if things go well). In our example, 4x leverage meant we only put in $200M for a $400M company.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">2. EBITDA Growth</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Revenue growth and/or margin expansion increase the value of the business. In our example, 10% annual growth drove EBITDA from $50M to $80.5M.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">3. Multiple Expansion</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Selling at a higher multiple than you paid increases returns. If we exited at 9x instead of 8x, exit equity would be $725M (3.6x MOIC) instead of $639M (3.2x).</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">4. Debt Paydown</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">As debt is repaid, more enterprise value accrues to equity holders. We paid down $195M of debt, which all went to equity value.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Sensitivity Analysis: What to Mention</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">After solving the base case, interviewers often ask about sensitivities. Know how to discuss:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Entry multiple sensitivity:</strong>
"If we paid 7x instead of 8x, our entry equity would be $150M instead of $200M, improving returns significantly."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Exit multiple sensitivity:</strong>
"Each turn of exit multiple is worth roughly $80M in this case (exit EBITDA). At 9x exit, we'd generate $725M vs $639M at 8x."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Leverage sensitivity:</strong>
"Higher leverage magnifies returns but increases risk. At 5x debt instead of 4x, our equity check would be $150M, but we'd need stronger cash flows to service the debt."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Growth sensitivity:</strong>
"If EBITDA only grows 5% instead of 10%, exit EBITDA would be ~$64M, and returns would compress to roughly 2x MOIC."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 1: Forgetting to Subtract Debt at Exit</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A common error is calculating exit EV but forgetting to subtract remaining debt to get equity value. The question is always about equity returns, not EV returns.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 2: Over-Complicating the Math</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Paper LBOs test concepts, not Excel skills. Round numbers aggressively. $117M becomes $120M. You're not graded on decimal precision.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 3: Confusing MOIC and IRR</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">MOIC tells you "how much did I make?" IRR tells you "how fast did I make it?" A 3x MOIC over 3 years is very different from 3x over 10 years.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 4: Ignoring Cash Flow Constraints</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If debt interest exceeds cash flow, the company can't service its debt. In paper LBOs this is often simplified away, but mention you'd check debt service capacity in a real model.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 5: Not Articulating the Drivers</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">After calculating returns, explain what's driving them: "The 26% IRR is driven primarily by EBITDA growth (60% of the EBITDA increase) and debt paydown (nearly full paydown over 5 years)."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Quick Mental Math Tricks</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Compound growth shortcut:</strong>
