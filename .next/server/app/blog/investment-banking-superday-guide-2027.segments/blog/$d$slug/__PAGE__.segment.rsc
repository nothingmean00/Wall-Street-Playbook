You've submitted your application. You've networked. You've survived the HireVue. Now you're facing the final gate: the Superday.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A Superday is the last step in the investment banking summer analyst recruiting process—a high-pressure gauntlet of 3-6 back-to-back interviews that determines whether you get an offer. For the 2027 cycle, here's exactly what the process looks like, what you'll face, and how to walk in prepared.</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">Don't walk into a Superday without this.</strong> Our [Finance Technical Interview Guide](/playbooks/ib-technical-guide) covers every question tagged by how often it's asked—88 pages with 30-second and 3-minute answer formats, red flag warnings, and self-assessment scorecards.</blockquote><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The 2027 Recruiting Process: From Application to Offer</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Before diving into Superday specifics, let's map the full pipeline. Understanding where you are in the funnel helps you prepare for what's next.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Stage 1: Online Application</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What happens:</strong> You submit your resume, transcript, and cover letter through the bank's careers portal. Some banks also ask for short-answer responses.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Pass rate:</strong> Roughly 10-15% of applicants advance (lower at elite boutiques, higher at middle-market banks).</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What matters most:</strong>
- GPA (3.5+ for bulge brackets, 3.7+ for elite boutiques)
- Relevant experience (finance internships, investment clubs, relevant coursework)
- School brand (target vs. non-target—though non-targets absolutely can advance with strong profiles)
- Employee referrals (the single biggest factor in getting past this stage)</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Stage 2: HireVue / Online Assessment</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What happens:</strong> You receive a link to complete a one-way video interview (HireVue) and/or a behavioral assessment (Pymetrics). The major banks using these for 2027 recruiting include JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">HireVue format:</strong>
- 3-5 pre-recorded questions
- 30 seconds to prepare each answer
- 60-180 seconds to record your response
- AI evaluates content, facial expressions, eye contact, voice tone, and body language
- Total assessment takes 20-30 minutes</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Common HireVue questions:</strong>
1. Walk me through your resume (2 minutes)
2. Why investment banking? (90 seconds)
3. Why this firm? (90 seconds)
4. Tell me about a time you showed leadership under pressure (90 seconds)
5. Describe a situation where you had to analyze complex information to make a decision (90 seconds)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">How to prepare:</strong>
- Record yourself answering practice questions at least 10 times
- Check your setup: well-lit room, clean background, camera at eye level
- Wear a full suit (not just a dress shirt—some banks can see your full frame)
- Look directly at the camera lens, not your face on screen
- Internet speed must be at least 350 Kbps—run a speed test beforehand
- Speak naturally, not robotically—the AI detects rehearsed delivery</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">Pro tip:</strong> The biggest HireVue mistake is looking at yourself instead of the camera. Tape a small arrow next to your webcam lens to remind yourself where to look.</blockquote><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Pymetrics format:</strong>
- Series of neuroscience-based games testing cognitive and behavioral traits
- No right or wrong answers—it measures fit with the bank's successful employee profiles
- Takes about 25 minutes
- You can't really prepare for this—just be yourself and answer honestly</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Stage 3: First-Round Interview (Phone Screen)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What happens:</strong> A 30-minute phone or video call, usually with an associate or VP. This is a quick filter to confirm you're competent and articulate.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What to expect:</strong>
- 2-3 behavioral questions ("Why banking?", "Walk me through your resume", "Tell me about a challenge")
- 2-3 technical questions (<a href="/blog/how-three-financial-statements-linked" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">three statements linkage</a>, <a href="/blog/enterprise-value-vs-equity-value-explained" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">EV vs. equity value</a>, basic DCF concepts)
- 1-2 market awareness questions ("What's a deal you've been following?")</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Pass rate:</strong> About 30-50% advance to Superday.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Key mistakes that kill you here:</strong>
- Not knowing your own resume cold
- Generic "Why banking?" answer with no specifics
- Stumbling on basic technicals that every candidate should know
- Not having a deal ready to discuss</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Stage 4: Superday (Final Round)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is the main event. Everything above is just qualification. The Superday is where offers are won or lost.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What Is a Superday, Exactly?</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A Superday is a marathon interview event where you sit through 3-6 consecutive interviews, each lasting 25-40 minutes, with bankers ranging from analysts to managing directors. The name is misleading—it's not a single day of celebration. It's the most intense few hours of your recruiting life.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">2027 format trends:</strong>
- Most bulge brackets are conducting Superdays <strong class="text-charcoal">in-person</strong> at their offices (NYC, SF, Chicago)
- Some banks still offer virtual options, especially for international candidates
- Elite boutiques tend to be in-person only
- The process typically runs 3-5 hours including wait time between interviews</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What the bank is evaluating:</strong>
- Technical competency (can you do the job?)
- Cultural fit (would we want to work with you at 2am?)
- Communication skills (can you present to clients?)
- Intellectual curiosity (do you actually care about this work?)
- Consistency (is your story the same across all interviewers?)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Superday Interview Breakdown</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Interview 1-2: Technical Deep Dives (Usually with Associates/VPs)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">These interviews test whether you have the foundational knowledge to contribute on day one. Expect questions like:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Accounting:</strong>
- Walk me through the three financial statements and how they connect
- If depreciation increases by $10, walk me through the impact on all three statements
- What's the difference between cash-based and accrual accounting?</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Valuation:</strong>
- What are the three main valuation methodologies? (<a href="/blog/trading-comps-vs-precedent-transactions" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">detailed breakdown here</a>)
- When would you use each one?
- <a href="/blog/walk-me-through-dcf-perfect-answer" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Walk me through a DCF</a>
- <a href="/blog/wacc-explained-simply-finance-interviews" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">What is WACC and how do you calculate it?</a>
- <a href="/blog/enterprise-value-vs-equity-value-explained" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Enterprise value vs. equity value</a>—what's the difference and how do you bridge between them?</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">M&A:</strong>
- Why would two companies merge?
- <a href="/blog/accretion-dilution-analysis-explained" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Walk me through accretion/dilution</a>
- What are synergies and how do you value them?
- Stock deal vs. cash deal—when would a buyer prefer each?</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">LBO (less common for SA, but asked at top banks):</strong>
- <a href="/blog/lbo-model-walkthrough-5-steps" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">What is an LBO and what makes a good LBO candidate?</a>
- Walk me through a <a href="/blog/paper-lbo-step-by-step-example" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">paper LBO</a>
- What are the main drivers of returns in an LBO?</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">How to study:</strong> Work through the [top 100 IB technical questions](/blog/100-investment-banking-technical-questions). Know the first 30 cold. Be comfortable with the next 40. Have awareness of the last 30.</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Interview 3-4: Behavioral / Fit (Usually with VPs/Directors)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">These interviews determine whether you're someone the team wants to spend 80-100 hours per week with. The questions seem simple, but your answers reveal everything.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The Big Five behavioral questions:</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">1. "Walk me through your resume."</strong>
This is your opening pitch. Keep it to 90 seconds. Tell a story with a clear arc: where you started → what sparked your interest in finance → what you've done to prepare → why you're sitting here today. <a href="/blog/walk-me-through-your-resume-interview-guide" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Full guide here</a>.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">2. "Why investment banking?"</strong>
Be specific. Name the type of work (M&A advisory, capital raising, strategic advice to CEOs). Reference a deal or experience that made it click. Avoid "I want to learn a lot" or "I like the fast-paced environment"—everyone says that.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">3. "Why this bank specifically?"</strong>
Research 2-3 recent deals the bank advised on. Mention a conversation you had with someone at the bank (networking pays off here). Reference something specific about the bank's culture, deal flow, or group structure.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">4. "Tell me about a time you led a team through a challenge."</strong>
Use the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result) but don't make it sound formulaic. The best answers show self-awareness and genuine reflection.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">5. "Tell me about a time you failed."</strong>
This is a trap if you give a fake answer ("I worked too hard"). Give a real failure. Explain what you learned. Show that you're self-aware and growth-oriented.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Interview 5-6: Senior Interviews (Directors/MDs)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Senior bankers care less about whether you can calculate WACC and more about:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Market awareness:</strong> What's happening in the markets right now? What sectors are hot for M&A? What's the Fed doing and why does it matter?</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Deal knowledge:</strong> Pick 2-3 recent transactions and know them deeply—not just the headline, but the strategic rationale, the valuation, the buyer's logic, and the deal structure</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Intellectual curiosity:</strong> Do you read the FT or WSJ? Can you hold a conversation about macro trends?</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Maturity:</strong> Can this person sit in a client meeting without embarrassing us?</li></ul><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">The MD test:</strong> Senior bankers are asking themselves one question: "Would I put this person in front of a client?" Everything you say and do in this interview should answer "yes."</blockquote><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Day-Of Strategy</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">The Night Before</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80">Lay out your suit, shirt, tie, shoes, belt—everything</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Print 5 copies of your resume on quality paper</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Charge your phone, set 2 alarms</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Review your key stories, technical frameworks, and deal discussions one final time</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Sleep at least 7 hours—exhaustion kills performance</li></ul><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Morning Of</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80">Arrive 15-20 minutes early.

Be consistent.</li></ol><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Weak "Why this bank?" answer.</strong> If you can't name a specific deal or specific person you've spoken with at the bank, it signals you didn't do your homework.</li></ol><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Overconfidence.</strong> Confidence is good. Arrogance is fatal. The best candidates are quietly confident—they know their stuff and don't need to prove it.</li></ol><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Crumbling on a technical question you should know.</strong> You can miss an advanced LBO question.

Ask about deal flow, team culture, what the interviewer enjoys most. Never ask about hours, pay, or exit opportunities.</li></ol><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Looking at your phone.</strong> Even checking the time signals disinterest.

- Most banks make decisions within 1-3 business days after your Superday
- Some (like Goldman Sachs) may give same-day offers
- If you haven't heard within a week, follow up politely with your recruiting contact</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">If you get an offer:</strong>
- You typically have 1-2 weeks to decide (varies by bank)
- If you have competing Superdays scheduled, let the offering bank know—they may extend the deadline
- Negotiate only if you have competing offers—and even then, be diplomatic</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">If you get rejected:</strong>
- Ask for feedback (some banks provide it, many don't)
- Don't burn bridges—you may recruit with the same people for full-time roles
- Pivot to other opportunities: middle-market banks, boutiques, <a href="/blog/big-4-to-investment-banking-lateral-guide" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Big 4 advisory</a>
- Remember that rejection from one bank doesn't define your career—many successful bankers were rejected from their first-choice firm</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">If you're waitlisted:</strong>
