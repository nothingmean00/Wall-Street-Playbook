d:T3c59,<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
M&A questions are where IB interviews get serious. The accounting, valuation, and accounting chapters are warm-ups—M&A is where interviewers test whether you can actually think about deals, not just memorize formulas.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The centerpiece of M&A interview questions is accretion/dilution analysis. Here's how it works, why it matters, and the questions you'll face.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What Is Accretion/Dilution?</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">When Company A acquires Company B, the combined entity has a new EPS. The fundamental question:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Is the acquirer's EPS higher (accretive) or lower (dilutive) after the deal?</strong></p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Accretive:</strong> Combined EPS > Acquirer's standalone EPS → shareholders benefit</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Dilutive:</strong> Combined EPS < Acquirer's standalone EPS → shareholders are worse off (at least initially)</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Accretion/dilution analysis tells you whether a deal creates or destroys per-share value for the acquirer's shareholders in Year 1.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The P/E Rule: The Quick Mental Math</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is the shortcut every banker uses for stock deals:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">In an all-stock deal, if the acquirer's P/E is higher than the target's P/E, the deal is accretive. If the acquirer's P/E is lower, the deal is dilutive.</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why this works:</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Think of P/E as the "price" of a dollar of earnings. If Company A trades at 20x P/E and buys Company B at 15x P/E, Company A is buying earnings "cheaply"—each dollar of B's earnings costs less than a dollar of A's earnings is valued by the market. The combined EPS increases.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Example:</strong>
- Company A: P/E 20x, EPS $2.00, 100M shares, Price $40
- Company B: P/E 12x, EPS $3.00, 50M shares, Price $36</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A buys B in all stock at market price. Exchange ratio = $36/$40 = 0.9x. A issues 0.9 × 50M = 45M new shares.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Combined:</strong>
- Combined earnings: ($2 × 100M) + ($3 × 50M) = $350M
- Combined shares: 100M + 45M = 145M
- Combined EPS: $350M / 145M = <strong class="text-charcoal">$2.41</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Acquirer's standalone EPS was $2.00 → Deal is <strong class="text-charcoal">accretive</strong> by $0.41.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This makes sense: A's P/E (20x) > B's P/E (12x).</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">What About Cash Deals?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">For all-cash deals, the test is different:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Is the yield on the target's earnings greater than the after-tax cost of debt (or the opportunity cost of the cash used)?</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If Company A uses cash to buy B, there's no share dilution. But A either:
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Borrows</strong> to fund the deal (cost = after-tax interest expense)
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Uses cash on hand</strong> (cost = lost interest income on that cash)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If the earnings gained from B exceed the financing cost, the deal is accretive.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Example:</strong> A buys B for $1.8B in cash, funded by debt at 5% pre-tax (4% after-tax). B earns $150M.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80">Earnings gained: $150M</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Cost of debt: $1.8B × 4% = $72M</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Net earnings impact: +$78M → <strong class="text-charcoal">Accretive</strong></li></ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Purchase Price Allocation & Goodwill</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">When Company A buys Company B, the target's assets and liabilities are "stepped up" to fair market value on A's balance sheet. This process is called <strong class="text-charcoal">purchase price allocation (PPA)</strong>.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Goodwill = Purchase Price - Fair Market Value of Net Identifiable Assets</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If A pays $500M for B, and B's net identifiable assets have a fair market value of $350M, goodwill = $150M.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Key interview points:</strong>
- Goodwill is <strong class="text-charcoal">not amortized</strong> under GAAP (it is under IFRS)
- Goodwill is <strong class="text-charcoal">tested for impairment</strong> annually
- If impaired, it's written down as a non-cash charge on the income statement
- The stepped-up asset values may result in higher depreciation, which affects post-deal earnings</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">RED FLAG:</strong> When candidates say "goodwill is the premium you pay," that's incomplete. Goodwill is specifically the excess OVER fair value of identifiable assets. Some of the premium goes to stepping up tangible and intangible assets (brand value, customer lists, patents).</blockquote><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Stock Deal vs. Cash Deal vs. Asset Deal</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Stock vs. Cash Acquisition</h3><div class="my-6 overflow-x-auto rounded-lg border border-border"><table class="w-full"><thead><tr><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Factor</th><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Stock Deal</th><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Cash Deal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Share dilution</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Yes</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">No</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Accreted/diluted by</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">P/E comparison</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Earnings yield vs. cost of debt</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Risk to acquirer shareholders</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Shared (target gets equity)</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Borne entirely by acquirer</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Tax impact to target shareholders</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Tax-deferred</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Taxable immediately</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">When would a company prefer stock?</strong> When its shares are overvalued (it's using expensive currency cheaply), when it wants to conserve cash, or when it wants the target's shareholders aligned as owners.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">When would it prefer cash?</strong> When shares are undervalued (don't want to issue cheap currency), when it has excess cash or cheap debt, or when it's confident in the deal's returns.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Stock Deal vs. Asset Deal</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is a different concept—it's about legal structure:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Stock deal:</strong> Buyer acquires the target's shares.

- Sellers prefer stock deals (capital gains treatment on shares)
- Buyers prefer asset deals (step-up in tax basis of assets, reducing future tax through higher depreciation)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Merger Model: Key Interview Questions</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Walk me through a basic merger model."</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Step 1:</strong> Project both companies' standalone financials
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 2:</strong> Determine the offer price and deal structure (cash, stock, or mix)
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 3:</strong> Calculate purchase price allocation (goodwill, asset step-ups)
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 4:</strong> Calculate financing (new debt, foregone interest on cash used, new shares issued)
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 5:</strong> Combine the income statements, adding synergies and subtracting new costs
<strong class="text-charcoal">Step 6:</strong> Calculate pro forma EPS and compare to the acquirer's standalone EPS → accretive or dilutive?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"What are synergies?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Cost synergies:</strong> Eliminating redundant costs (duplicate HQ, overlapping sales teams, shared IT infrastructure). Typically 5-10% of the smaller company's cost base. More predictable.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Revenue synergies:</strong> Cross-selling products, accessing new markets, pricing power. Harder to quantify and realize. Investors are more skeptical of revenue synergies.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"How do you account for synergies in a merger model?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Add synergies (net of implementation costs) to the combined income statement. They directly increase the combined earnings, making the deal more accretive.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Be careful:</strong> Don't double-count. Synergies should be incremental, not already embedded in each company's standalone projections.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"An acquirer pays a 30% premium. Is the deal accretive or dilutive?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">You can't tell from the premium alone.</strong> It depends on:
- Deal structure (stock vs. cash)
- Relative P/E multiples
- Financing costs
- Synergies</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A 30% premium with significant synergies could easily be accretive. The premium is what you pay; accretion/dilution is about what you get.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Summary Cheat Sheet</h2><div class="my-6 overflow-x-auto rounded-lg border border-border"><table class="w-full"><thead><tr><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Concept</th><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Key Point</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Accretive deal</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Combined EPS > Acquirer standalone EPS</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Dilutive deal</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Combined EPS < Acquirer standalone EPS</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">P/E rule (stock deal)</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Higher P/E buys lower P/E = accretive</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Cash deal test</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Earnings yield > after-tax cost of debt = accretive</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Goodwill</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Purchase price - FMV of net identifiable assets</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Control premium</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">20-40% above unaffected market price</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Cost synergies</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Eliminating redundancies, 5-10% of target's costs</td></tr></tbody></table></div><hr class="my-10 border-gold/30" /><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Related Reading</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/trading-comps-vs-precedent-transactions" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Trading Comps vs. Precedent Transactions</a> — How deals are valued before they happen</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/lbo-model-walkthrough-5-steps" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">LBO Model Walkthrough: 5 Steps</a> — The other major deal type</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/enterprise-value-vs-equity-value-explained" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Enterprise Value vs. Equity Value</a> — Critical for understanding transaction values</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><em>M&A is covered in Chapter 5 of our <a href="/playbooks/ib-technical-guide" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Finance Technical Interview Guide</a>.
