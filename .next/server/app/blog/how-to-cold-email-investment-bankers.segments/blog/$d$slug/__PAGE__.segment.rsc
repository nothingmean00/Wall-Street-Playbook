Cold emailing bankers is a numbers game—but it's a game with specific rules. Break them, and your email gets deleted. Follow them, and you'll get the calls that lead to interviews.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's exactly how to write cold emails that get responses.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The 5 Rules of Cold Emailing Bankers</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Rule 1: Keep It Under 5 Sentences</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Bankers read email on their phones between meetings. If they have to scroll, they won't read.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Your email should be:</strong>
- Subject line
- Greeting
- Who you are (1 sentence)
- Why you're reaching out (1-2 sentences)
- The ask (1 sentence)
- Sign-off</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Rule 2: Make It Easy to Say Yes</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Don't ask for a 30-minute call. Ask for 10-15 minutes. Don't ask "when are you free?" Offer specific times.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Bad:</strong> "Would you have time to chat sometime about your experience?"
<strong class="text-charcoal">Good:</strong> "Would you have 10 minutes for a call Tuesday or Wednesday after 6pm?"</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Rule 3: Give Them a Reason to Respond</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Why should they help you specifically? Find a connection point:
- Same school/alumni
- Same hometown or region
- Shared interest or background
- Specific deal they worked on</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Rule 4: Don't Ask for a Job</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">You're asking for advice and information—not a job. Mentioning job-seeking in a cold email triggers an automatic "talk to HR" response.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Rule 5: Follow Up (But Don't Stalk)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Most responses come after follow-ups. Send 2-3 follow-ups spaced 5-7 days apart. After that, move on.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Email Templates That Work</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Template 1: Alumni Connection</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Subject:</strong> [University] Student – Quick Question on [Group]</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">Hi [Name],
