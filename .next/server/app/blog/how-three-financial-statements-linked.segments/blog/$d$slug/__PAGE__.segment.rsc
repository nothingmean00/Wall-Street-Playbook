"Walk me through how the three financial statements are linked."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is the single most common opening question in investment banking interviews. It's asked at Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Evercore, Lazard—every firm, every time. If you stumble here, the interview is effectively over before it begins.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's how to nail it, plus the deeper logic that separates good answers from great ones.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The 30-Second Answer</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Net income</strong> from the bottom of the income statement flows to the top of the cash flow statement. You then adjust for non-cash charges (like D&A) and changes in working capital to get <strong class="text-charcoal">cash flow from operations</strong>. After accounting for investing and financing activities, you arrive at the <strong class="text-charcoal">net change in cash</strong>, which updates the cash line on the balance sheet.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Meanwhile, net income also flows to <strong class="text-charcoal">retained earnings</strong> on the balance sheet through shareholders' equity. And the balance sheet must always balance: <strong class="text-charcoal">Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong>.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">That's the answer that gets you a check mark. But here's what actually impresses interviewers.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Deep Dive: Building the Intuition</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Start With a Business Transaction</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Imagine you start a coffee shop. You invest $500K of equity and borrow $300K from a bank. Day one, your balance sheet looks like this:</p><div class="my-6 overflow-x-auto rounded-lg border border-border"><table class="w-full"><thead><tr><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Assets</th><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Liabilities + Equity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Cash: $800K</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Debt: $300K</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Equity: $500K</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50"><strong>Total: $800K</strong></td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50"><strong>Total: $800K</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Now you buy an espresso machine for $100K. Cash decreases by $100K, PP&E increases by $100K. The balance sheet still balances—you've just shifted the composition of assets.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">The Income Statement Kicks In</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">In Year 1, your coffee shop generates:
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Revenue:</strong> $400K

This is crucial—D&A is a non-cash expense. It reduced net income, but no actual cash left the building. We add it back to reflect the true cash generated.</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">RED FLAG:</strong> A common interview mistake is saying "D&A is added back because it's not a real expense." Wrong. It IS a real expense—it represents the wear and tear on your assets. It's added back because it's <em>non-cash</em>. The cash already left when you bought the machine.</blockquote><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Adjust for working capital changes.</strong> If customers owe you $30K (accounts receivable increased), that's revenue you booked but haven't collected. Subtract $30K. If you owe suppliers $10K more than last year (accounts payable increased), that's cash you haven't spent yet. Add $10K.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Cash from operations:</strong> $86.25K + $20K - $30K + $10K = <strong class="text-charcoal">$86.25K</strong></p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Investing and Financing Activities</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Investing:</strong> You bought $50K more equipment.

This is why working capital adjustments exist.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Common Interview Traps</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Trap 1: "Which statement is most important?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The interviewer wants to see you think, not regurgitate. A strong answer:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><em>"It depends on the context. A lender cares most about the cash flow statement—can the company service its debt? A growth investor focuses on the income statement—is the company generating increasing profitability? But ultimately, the balance sheet is the foundation because it captures the cumulative financial position."</em></p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Trap 2: "Can you have positive net income and go bankrupt?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Yes.</strong> This is the classic accrual vs. cash trap. A company can book $10M in revenue (raising net income) but if customers don't pay, cash flow is negative. If debt repayments come due and there's no cash to service them, the company defaults—even with a "profitable" income statement.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Trap 3: "What happens if inventory increases?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Inventory is a working capital item. If inventory increases by $50K, that's cash you've spent buying inventory that hasn't been sold yet. It's an <em>increase in current assets</em>, which is a <strong class="text-charcoal">use of cash</strong>. Cash flow from operations decreases by $50K.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The 3-Statement Framework Cheat Sheet</h2><div class="my-6 overflow-x-auto rounded-lg border border-border"><table class="w-full"><thead><tr><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Transaction</th><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Income Statement</th><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Cash Flow Statement</th><th class="px-3 py-2 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-navy bg-navy/5 border-b border-border">Balance Sheet</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Revenue (collected)</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Revenue ↑, NI ↑</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">CFO ↑</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Cash ↑, RE ↑</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Revenue (uncollected)</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Revenue ↑, NI ↑</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">NI ↑ but AR offset</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">AR ↑, RE ↑</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Depreciation ↑</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">NI ↓</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">NI ↓ but D&A add-back</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">PP&E ↓, RE ↓</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">CapEx</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">No direct effect</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">CFI ↓</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Cash ↓, PP&E ↑</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Debt repayment</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">No direct effect</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">CFF ↓</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Cash ↓, Debt ↓</td></tr><tr><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Stock issuance</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">No direct effect</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">CFF ↑</td><td class="px-3 py-2 text-xs text-charcoal/70 border-b border-border/50">Cash ↑, Equity ↑</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">How to Practice This</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The best way to internalize these concepts is to trace transactions through all three statements yourself.
