"Walk me through a DCF" is the single most asked technical question in investment banking interviews. It's so common that interviewers can tell within 30 seconds whether you actually understand valuation or just memorized a script.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's how to answer it properly—with the depth that separates strong candidates from average ones.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The 60-Second Answer</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">For initial screens, you need a concise version:</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"A DCF values a company based on the present value of its future cash flows.
First, I project unlevered free cash flows for 5-10 years. That's EBIT times one minus the tax rate, plus depreciation and amortization, minus capital expenditures, minus changes in net working capital.
Second, I calculate the terminal value—either using a perpetuity growth method or an exit multiple.
Third, I discount both the projected cash flows and terminal value back to present value using WACC.
Finally, I sum those present values to get enterprise value, then subtract net debt to get equity value."</blockquote><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">That's your foundation. But interviewers will dig deeper.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Full Framework (For Follow-Up Questions)</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 1: Project Unlevered Free Cash Flows</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The formula:</strong>
UFCF = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - CapEx - ΔNWC</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why unlevered?</strong>
We use unlevered (debt-free) cash flows because we're valuing the entire enterprise, not just equity. Debt and interest are captured in the discount rate (WACC).</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Projection period:</strong>
Typically 5-10 years. Use 5 years for stable companies, longer for high-growth businesses that need more time to reach steady state.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Key drivers to model:</strong>
- Revenue growth rate
- EBITDA margins (or individual expense items)
- D&A as % of revenue or CapEx
- CapEx as % of revenue
- NWC as % of revenue</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 2: Calculate Terminal Value</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Two methods—know both:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Perpetuity Growth Method:</strong>
TV = (Final Year FCF × (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Where g = long-term growth rate (typically 2-3%, roughly GDP growth)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Exit Multiple Method:</strong>
TV = Final Year EBITDA × Exit Multiple</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The exit multiple is usually based on current trading multiples for comparable companies.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Which to use?</strong>
Most bankers calculate both and use them as a sanity check. If they give wildly different answers, reexamine your assumptions.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 3: Calculate WACC</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The formula:</strong>
WACC = (E/V × Cost of Equity) + (D/V × Cost of Debt × (1 - Tax))</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Cost of Equity (via CAPM):</strong>
Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + β × Market Risk Premium</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80">Risk-free rate: 10-year Treasury yield</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Beta: Measure of stock volatility vs. market (levered beta from comps, unlever/relever as needed)</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Market risk premium: Typically 5-7%</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Cost of Debt:</strong>
The company's current borrowing rate, tax-affected since interest is deductible.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 4: Discount to Present Value</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Formula:</strong>
PV = CF / (1 + WACC)^n</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Apply to each year's projected cash flow and to the terminal value.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 5: Bridge to Equity Value</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Enterprise Value</strong> = Sum of PV of projected cash flows + PV of terminal value</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Equity Value</strong> = Enterprise Value - Net Debt - Preferred Stock - Minority Interest + Cash</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Implied Share Price</strong> = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Common Follow-Up Questions</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"What discount rate do you use and why?"</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"WACC, because we're discounting unlevered free cash flows which are available to all capital providers—both debt and equity. WACC weights each source of capital by its proportion in the capital structure and cost."</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"What growth rate do you use for terminal value?"</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"Typically 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term GDP growth. A company can't grow faster than the economy in perpetuity—if it did, it would eventually become the entire economy. For inflation-protected analysis, you might use 0-1% real growth."</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Why is terminal value often such a large percentage of total value?"</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"Because we're projecting explicit cash flows for only 5-10 years, but the terminal value captures all value creation beyond that. For mature companies, terminal value often represents 60-80% of total DCF value. This is why terminal value assumptions are so critical and why we sensitize them."</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Walk me through how changes in working capital affect the DCF."</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"Net working capital represents cash tied up in operations—inventory, receivables, payables. If NWC increases, that's cash being invested in operations, so we subtract it. If NWC decreases, cash is being released, so it's additive to free cash flow.
For example, if a company grows revenue but needs more inventory to support that growth, NWC increases and FCF decreases relative to EBITDA."</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"What are the limitations of a DCF?"</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"The DCF is highly sensitive to assumptions—small changes in discount rate or terminal growth can swing value significantly. It relies on accurate projections of future cash flows, which are inherently uncertain. It also doesn't capture real-time market sentiment, which is why we use DCF alongside trading comps and transaction comps for triangulation."</blockquote><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Sensitivity Analysis</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Always be prepared to discuss sensitivity. Key sensitivities include:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80">Terminal growth rate vs. WACC</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">WACC vs. revenue growth</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">EBITDA margin assumptions</li><li class="text-charcoal/80">Exit multiple (if using exit method)</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Understanding what drives value changes shows you truly understand the model, not just the mechanics.</p><hr class="my-10 border-gold/30" /><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><em>Want to master all 400+ technical questions?
