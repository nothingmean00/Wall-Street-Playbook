18:T2a3f,<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
The Big 4 to investment banking pipeline is real—but it's not automatic. Thousands of people work at Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG hoping to lateral into banking, but only a fraction actually make the move.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's exactly how to position yourself for success.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Reality Check</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Good news:</strong> Big 4 experience, especially in Transaction Advisory Services (TAS), is a legitimate path to investment banking. Banks hire laterals from Big 4 regularly.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Reality:</strong> It's competitive. You're competing against other Big 4 laterals and against people who took the direct banking path. You need a clear strategy.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Which Big 4 Roles Transition Best?</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Tier 1: Transaction Advisory Services (TAS/Deals)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Groups:</strong> Financial Due Diligence, M&A Advisory, Valuation, Transaction Services</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why it works:</strong> You're already doing deal-adjacent work. FDD analysts review financials for PE and strategic acquirers. You understand deal processes, work with bankers, and have exposure to transaction dynamics.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Placement rate:</strong> Highest among Big 4 roles. Banks actively recruit from TAS.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Tier 2: Restructuring</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why it works:</strong> Restructuring is a specialized, high-demand skill. Banks with RX groups (Houlihan Lokey, PJT, Lazard) recruit from Big 4 restructuring practices.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Placement rate:</strong> Good, especially for RX-specific banking roles.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Tier 3: Corporate Finance / M&A Advisory</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why it works:</strong> Some Big 4 offices have small M&A advisory practices that work on middle-market deals. This is closest to actual banking work.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Placement rate:</strong> Good, but these groups are smaller.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Tier 4: Valuations</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why it works:</strong> You understand valuation methodologies, model regularly, and work on transaction-related projects.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Placement rate:</strong> Moderate. Banks see it as relevant but not as deal-focused as TAS.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Tier 5: Audit and Tax</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Reality:</strong> This is a harder transition. Audit and tax are valuable skills, but they're further from deal execution.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Path:</strong> Usually requires moving to TAS first, then to banking. Direct audit-to-IB moves are rare (though not impossible for exceptional candidates).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Timeline</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Year 1 at Big 4:</strong> Learn the job, perform well, build your skills. Start networking with bankers casually.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Year 1.5 - 2:</strong> Begin active networking for banking roles. Target middle-market banks and banks that hire laterals. Apply to off-cycle openings.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Year 2 - 3:</strong> This is the optimal window. You have enough experience to be useful but aren't too senior to start as an Analyst 1.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Year 3+:</strong> Still possible, but you may come in as a more senior analyst or need to consider the Associate path (possibly via MBA).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Positioning Your Experience</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">How to Talk About Big 4 on Your Resume</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Don't:</strong> "Performed financial due diligence on various transactions"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Do:</strong> "Executed financial due diligence on 12+ M&A transactions totaling $3B+ in enterprise value across technology and healthcare sectors"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Emphasize:</strong>
- Number of deals
- Deal sizes (be accurate)
- Industries covered
- Specific skills: modeling, analysis, presentations
- Any client-facing work</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">How to Talk About Big 4 in Interviews</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Common question:</strong> "Why didn't you go directly into banking?"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Good answer:</strong>
> "When I was graduating, I was interested in finance but not certain banking was the right fit. I chose TAS because it offered deal exposure while I confirmed my interest. After two years of working closely with bankers on transactions, I'm certain I want to be on the advisory side executing deals rather than supporting them."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Avoid:</strong>
- "I couldn't get a banking offer out of school" (even if true)
- "I wanted better work-life balance initially" (signals you might not want IB hours)
- Anything that suggests banking is a backup plan</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Networking Strategy</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Who to Target</h3><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Big 4 alumni now in banking</strong> — They understand your background and can advocate</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Bankers at firms that hire laterals</strong> — Middle-market banks, some boutiques</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Headhunters</strong> — Some specialize in Big 4 to banking moves</li></ol><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">What to Say</h3><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4">"I'm currently in [Group] at [Big 4 firm], working on [type of transactions].

- Middle-market banks (William Blair, Baird, Piper Sandler)
- Sector-specific boutiques (especially if you have industry expertise)
- Some bulge bracket groups (varies by office and need)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Less common but possible:</strong>
- Elite boutiques (Evercore, Lazard, etc.) — Harder, but happens
- Bulge bracket "name" groups — Competitive, but Big 4 isn't disqualifying</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Strategy:</strong> Cast a wide net. Don't only target Goldman Sachs—you'll have better odds at middle-market banks, and the experience can be excellent.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Technical Bar</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Banks expect Big 4 laterals to be technically sharp.
