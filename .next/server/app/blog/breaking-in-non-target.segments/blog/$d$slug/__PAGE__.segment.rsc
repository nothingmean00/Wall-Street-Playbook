Every year, candidates from non-target schools break into Goldman Sachs, Evercore, and other top-tier firms. The path is harder, but it is well-defined for those willing to execute.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-10 mb-4">The Reality Check</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80">Non-target recruiting requires starting earlier, working harder, and being more strategic than your target-school competition. You cannot rely on on-campus recruiting or alumni density. You must manufacture every advantage.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-10 mb-4">The Networking Imperative</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80">Your entire strategy centers on one activity: building relationships with people who can refer you or advocate for your candidacy. This means 50-100+ networking conversations before recruiting begins.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80">Start with second-degree connections: alumni from your school, friends of friends, people from your hometown. Expand from there. Every conversation should end with two new names to contact.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-10 mb-4">The Technical Edge</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80">When you lack the pedigree, you compensate with preparation. Non-target candidates who break in are often more technically prepared than their target-school peers because they had to be.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80">Master technicals before recruiting begins. Not during—before. Your accounting, valuation, and deal knowledge should be flawless.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-10 mb-4">The Story</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80">Your narrative must be airtight. Why finance? Why now? Why you despite your school? The best non-target candidates frame their background as an asset: grit, resourcefulness, and the drive that comes from having to earn every opportunity.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80">The path is harder. But for candidates willing to execute this playbook, it works.
