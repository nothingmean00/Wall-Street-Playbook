The LBO is the final boss of technical interview questions. If you're interviewing at a PE fund, you'll build one on a whiteboard. If you're at an investment bank, you'll be asked to explain the mechanics conceptually. Either way, you need to know this cold.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's the 5-step framework for building and explaining an LBO, plus the return drivers that PE firms actually evaluate.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What Is an LBO?</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A leveraged buyout is when a financial sponsor (PE fund) acquires a company using a significant amount of borrowed money (leverage). The company's cash flows service the debt over a 3-7 year holding period, and the sponsor exits at a profit.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The core concept:</strong> Use other people's money to amplify returns. If you put $400M of equity into a $1B deal, and sell the company for $1.5B after paying down $400M of debt, your equity goes from $400M to $1.1B—a 2.75x return. That's dramatically better than the 1.5x return if you'd bought with all equity.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Step 1: Sources & Uses</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is the opening table of every LBO. It answers: <strong class="text-charcoal">Where does the money come from, and where does it go?</strong></p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Uses (What You're Spending)
- **Purchase price:** Enterprise value of the target (e.g., 10x EBITDA)
- **Transaction fees:** Advisory, financing, legal (typically 2-5% of EV)
- **Refinancing of existing debt:** Most targets have existing debt that gets paid off</h3><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Sources (Where the Money Comes From)
- **Senior secured debt** (Term Loan A, Term Loan B)
- **Subordinated debt** (high-yield bonds, mezzanine)
- **Sponsor equity** (the PE fund's check)
- **Management rollover** (sometimes management reinvests their equity)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Example:</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">| Sources | Amount | Uses | Amount |
|---------|--------|------|--------|
| Term Loan B (4.0x) | $400M | Enterprise Value (10x) | $1,000M |
| Senior Notes (2.0x) | $200M | Transaction Fees | $35M |
| Sponsor Equity | $435M | Refinance Existing Debt | $0 |
| <strong class="text-charcoal">Total</strong> | <strong class="text-charcoal">$1,035M</strong> | <strong class="text-charcoal">Total</strong> | <strong class="text-charcoal">$1,035M</strong> |</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The leverage ratio:</strong> Total debt / EBITDA. In this example, $600M / $100M = 6.0x. Current market standard for LBOs is 4-7x total leverage.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Step 2: Build the Operating Model</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Project the target's financial performance over the hold period (typically 5 years):</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Revenue growth:</strong> Conservative assumptions (PE doesn't buy miracles)</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">EBITDA margin:</strong> Usually stable or improving through operational improvements</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">CapEx:</strong> Maintenance levels (growth capex is separate)</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Working capital:</strong> Changes as % of revenue</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What PE firms actually look for in targets:</strong>
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Stable, predictable cash flows</strong> — Can service debt reliably
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Strong market position</strong> — Defensible competitive advantage
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Multiple expansion potential</strong> — Can the multiple increase by exit?
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Operational improvement opportunity</strong> — Margin expansion through efficiency
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Low CapEx requirements</strong> — More cash available for debt paydown</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">RED FLAG:</strong> Candidates often project aggressive growth rates in LBO models. PE firms are conservative—they need to service debt regardless of growth. A good LBO candidate doesn't need growth to generate returns.</blockquote><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Step 3: Construct the Debt Schedule</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is where the leverage magic happens. Map out each debt tranche:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">For each debt tranche, track:</strong>
- Beginning balance
- Mandatory amortization (e.g., Term Loan A: 5-10% annual paydown)
- Optional prepayments (from excess cash flow)
- Ending balance</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Cash flow sweep:</strong> Most LBOs include a "cash sweep" where 50-75% of excess cash flow automatically prepays debt. This accelerates deleveraging.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Typical debt structure (2026 market):</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">| Tranche | Size | Rate | Amortization |
|---------|------|------|-------------|
| Revolving Credit | 1.0x | SOFR+250 | None (drawn as needed) |
| Term Loan B | 3.0-4.0x | SOFR+350-450 | 1% annual |
| Senior Notes | 1.5-2.5x | 7-9% fixed | Bullet (repaid at maturity) |
| Mezzanine (if needed) | 0.5-1.0x | 10-13% | PIK or bullet |</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Total leverage: 5.0-7.0x EBITDA</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The interest expense from the debt schedule flows into the income statement and reduces taxable income (creating the tax shield that makes debt efficient).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Step 4: Calculate Returns</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">At exit (typically Year 5), the sponsor sells the company. Returns are measured two ways:</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">MOIC = Exit Equity Value / Initial Equity Investment</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If you put in $435M and get back $1.1B, MOIC = 2.5x.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">PE return targets:</strong>
- 2.0x MOIC = acceptable
- 2.5x MOIC = good
- 3.0x+ MOIC = excellent</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">IRR (Internal Rate of Return)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The annualized return that accounts for the time value of money.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Quick approximation (The Rule of 72):</strong>
- 2.0x over 5 years ≈ 15% IRR
- 2.5x over 5 years ≈ 20% IRR
- 3.0x over 5 years ≈ 25% IRR</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">PE return targets:</strong>
- 15-20% = minimum threshold
- 20-25% = target range for most funds
- 25%+ = exceptional</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Step 5: Analyze the Return Drivers</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is what separates a great LBO answer from a good one. There are <strong class="text-charcoal">4 ways to generate returns</strong> in an LBO:</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">1. EBITDA Growth (Operational Improvement)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If EBITDA grows from $100M to $140M over 5 years, that's organic value creation. This comes from revenue growth, margin expansion, or both.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">This is the most valued return driver</strong> — it indicates the sponsor actually improved the business.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">2. Multiple Expansion</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If you buy at 10x EBITDA and sell at 12x EBITDA, the same EBITDA is worth more at exit. This is partially market-driven (you can't control market sentiment) and partially operational (if you've improved the business profile, it may deserve a higher multiple).</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">PE firms model conservative multiples</strong> — entering and exiting at the same multiple is the base case. Multiple expansion is upside.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">3. Debt Paydown (Deleveraging)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">As the company's cash flows pay down debt, equity grows. If you entered with 6x leverage and exit with 3x leverage, the equity slice of the pie has grown even if the pie (EV) stays the same.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">This is the "mechanical" return driver</strong> — it works even without growth or multiple expansion, as long as the company generates enough cash to service and repay debt.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">4. Cash Generation / Dividends</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Some sponsors take dividend recaps or accumulate cash, effectively returning capital before exit. This boosts IRR by getting money back sooner.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Paper LBO: Quick Framework</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">For paper LBOs (done on a whiteboard in 10-15 minutes), simplify:</p><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Calculate purchase price:</strong> EBITDA × Entry Multiple</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Set up sources & uses:</strong> Leverage × EBITDA = debt, remainder = equity</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Project EBITDA:</strong> Growth rate × 5 years</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Calculate debt paydown:</strong> Annual FCF = EBITDA - Interest - Taxes - CapEx. Assume all FCF repays debt.</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Calculate exit:</strong> Exit EBITDA × Exit Multiple = Exit EV. Subtract remaining debt = Exit Equity.</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Calculate returns:</strong> MOIC = Exit Equity / Entry Equity.

If the total return on assets is 10% and you're borrowing at 5%, the difference is pure equity value creation. The more leverage, the higher the equity return—but also the higher the risk of default.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"What happens if the company can't service its debt?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">It restructures. Lenders may agree to extend maturities, reduce interest rates, or convert debt to equity. In worst cases, the company files for bankruptcy and equity holders (the PE fund) lose their investment. This is the fundamental risk of leverage.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Walk me through the difference between IRR and MOIC."</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">MOIC</strong> tells you how many dollars you get back per dollar invested. <strong class="text-charcoal">IRR</strong> tells you the annualized return, factoring in time. A 3.0x MOIC over 3 years (40% IRR) is far better than 3.0x over 10 years (12% IRR). PE funds optimize for both, but IRR matters more because investors compare returns across different time horizons.</p><hr class="my-10 border-gold/30" /><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Related Reading</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/paper-lbo-step-by-step-example" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Paper LBO: Step-by-Step Example</a> — The whiteboard version with full worked example</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/accretion-dilution-analysis-explained" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Accretion/Dilution Analysis Explained</a> — The M&A analysis framework</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/walk-me-through-dcf-perfect-answer" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Walk Me Through a DCF</a> — The other key valuation framework</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><em>LBOs are covered in Chapter 6 of our <a href="/playbooks/ib-technical-guide" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">IB Technical Interview Guide</a>.
