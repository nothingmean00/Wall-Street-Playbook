Accounting is the foundation of every finance interview. Whether you're interviewing for investment banking, private equity, or equity research, the first technical questions you'll face test whether you understand how business transactions flow through financial statements.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here are the 12 accounting questions that appear most frequently, based on real interview data from bulge brackets and elite boutiques. Each includes a quick-check answer and a deeper explanation for follow-ups.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">ALWAYS ASKED (Expect These in Every Interview)</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">1. Walk me through the three financial statements.</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
The income statement shows revenue and expenses over a period, ending with net income. The balance sheet shows assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time—it must always balance (Assets = Liabilities + Equity). The cash flow statement starts with net income, adjusts for non-cash items and working capital changes, then shows investing and financing activities to arrive at the ending cash balance.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What they're really testing:</strong> Can you explain this clearly in under 60 seconds without rambling? Interviewers have heard this answer thousands of times. Clarity and confidence matter more than depth here.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">2. How are the three statements linked?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
Net income flows from the income statement to the top of the cash flow statement and to retained earnings on the balance sheet. The cash flow statement adjusts net income for non-cash charges and working capital changes, then accounts for investing and financing to produce the change in cash—which updates the balance sheet. The balance sheet always balances.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Deep Dive:</strong> See our complete walkthrough in <a href="/blog/how-three-financial-statements-linked" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">How the 3 Financial Statements Are Linked</a>, with the coffee shop example that makes this click permanently.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">3. If depreciation increases by $10, walk me through the three statements (assume 40% tax rate).</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Income statement:</strong> Pre-tax income down $10, taxes down $4, net income down $6
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Cash flow statement:</strong> Net income down $6, but D&A add-back up $10, so cash up $4
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Balance sheet:</strong> Cash up $4, PP&E down $10 (accumulated depreciation). Assets down $6. Retained earnings down $6. Balances.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The Insight:</strong> The $4 cash increase is the <strong class="text-charcoal">tax shield</strong> from depreciation (D&A × tax rate). This concept appears in DCF, LBO, and M&A questions too.</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">RED FLAG:</strong> Don't say "depreciation isn't a real expense." It IS a real expense representing asset wear. It's added back on the cash flow statement because it's <em>non-cash</em>—the cash left when you bought the asset.</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">4. What is working capital? Walk me through an increase in accounts receivable.</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
Working capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities. If AR increases by $50, revenue was recognized but cash wasn't collected. On the income statement, revenue is up. On the cash flow statement, the AR increase is a <em>use</em> of cash—subtract $50 from CFO. On the balance sheet, AR is up but cash is down relative to where it would be.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why this matters:</strong> Working capital management is a core operating metric. In LBOs and DCFs, changes in NWC directly affect free cash flow.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Common follow-up:</strong> <em>"Is an increase in accounts payable good or bad for cash?"</em></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Good for cash. AP increasing means you owe more to suppliers—cash you haven't spent yet. It's a <em>source</em> of cash on the cash flow statement.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">FREQUENTLY ASKED (Appear in Most Interviews)</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">5. What's the difference between cash-based and accrual accounting?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
Cash-based accounting records revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. Accrual accounting records revenue when <em>earned</em> and expenses when <em>incurred</em>, regardless of cash timing. All public companies use accrual accounting under GAAP/IFRS.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Interview trap:</strong> <em>"Can a company be profitable but run out of cash?"</em> Yes—this is the fundamental limitation of accrual accounting. You can book revenue without collecting it, making the income statement look strong while cash bleeds out.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">6. Walk me through a $100 inventory write-down.</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Income statement:</strong> COGS up $100 (or write-down expense), pre-tax income down $100, taxes down $40, net income down $60
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Cash flow statement:</strong> Net income down $60, add back the $100 non-cash write-down, cash up $40
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Balance sheet:</strong> Inventory down $100, cash up $40. Assets down $60. Retained earnings down $60. Balances.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The pattern:</strong> Notice this follows the exact same structure as depreciation. Any non-cash expense creates a tax shield equal to the expense × tax rate.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">7. What is goodwill? How is it created?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
Goodwill is the premium paid above the fair market value of a company's net identifiable assets in an acquisition. If you buy a company for $500M and its net assets are worth $350M, goodwill is $150M. It sits on the acquirer's balance sheet as an intangible asset.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Key follow-up:</strong> <em>"Is goodwill amortized?"</em> Under GAAP, no—it's tested for impairment annually. Under IFRS, it can be amortized. If impaired, it's written down, flowing through the income statement as a non-cash charge.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">8. What's the difference between capitalizing and expensing?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
Expensing hits the income statement immediately—the full cost reduces current-period income. Capitalizing puts the cost on the balance sheet as an asset and expenses it gradually over time through depreciation or amortization. Capitalizing spreads the income statement impact across multiple periods.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why it matters:</strong> This distinction directly affects EBITDA, free cash flow, and valuation multiples. A company that capitalizes more will show higher current earnings but lower future earnings.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">SOMETIMES ASKED (Know the Concepts, Expect Follow-Ups)</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">9. What are deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
A <strong class="text-charcoal">deferred tax liability</strong> arises when a company pays less tax now than its income statement suggests (e.g., accelerated depreciation for tax purposes). It will owe more tax in the future. A <strong class="text-charcoal">deferred tax asset</strong> is the opposite—the company has overpaid or has future tax deductions (like NOLs) that will reduce future tax payments.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The common example:</strong> A company uses straight-line depreciation on its books but accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. Book income is higher than taxable income, creating a DTL.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">10. How does issuing stock affect the three statements?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Income statement:</strong> No impact (equity issuances don't flow through P&L)
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Cash flow statement:</strong> Cash from financing increases by the issuance proceeds
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Balance sheet:</strong> Cash up, shareholders' equity up by the same amount</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Follow-up trap:</strong> <em>"What about stock-based compensation?"</em> SBC is an expense on the income statement (reduces net income) but it's <em>non-cash</em>, so it's added back on the cash flow statement. It increases shares outstanding, which dilutes EPS.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">11. What's the difference between LIFO and FIFO?</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
FIFO (First In, First Out) assumes the oldest inventory is sold first. LIFO (Last In, First Out) assumes the newest inventory is sold first. In an inflationary environment, LIFO results in higher COGS (newer, more expensive inventory) and lower taxable income. FIFO results in lower COGS and higher reported earnings.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why banks care:</strong> This affects EBITDA comparability across companies. Analysts often adjust for inventory accounting differences when running comps.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">12. Walk me through how you'd build a simple 3-statement model.</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">30-Second Answer:</strong>
Start with the income statement—project revenue growth, margins, D&A, and interest expense to get net income. Build the balance sheet—project working capital items, PP&E (with CapEx and depreciation), and debt schedules. The cash flow statement bridges the two—start with net income, add back non-cash charges, adjust for working capital, subtract CapEx, and layer in debt and equity activities.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The key:</strong> The three statements must be dynamically linked. Changing a revenue assumption should cascade through all three. Interest expense should reference the debt balance on the balance sheet. Cash should be the plug.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Pattern Behind Every Accounting Question</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">If you look at these 12 questions, they all test the same core skill: <strong class="text-charcoal">can you trace a transaction through all three statements?</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The framework is always:
1. What hits the <strong class="text-charcoal">income statement</strong>? (Revenue or expense impact)
2. Is it <strong class="text-charcoal">cash or non-cash</strong>? (Determines the CFS adjustment)
3. What changes on the <strong class="text-charcoal">balance sheet</strong>? (Assets, liabilities, or equity)
4. <strong class="text-charcoal">Does it balance?</strong> (Always verify)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Master this framework and you can handle any accounting question they throw at you, even ones you've never seen before.</p><hr class="my-10 border-gold/30" /><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Free Resource</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Want a printable cheat sheet with the most commonly tested questions?
