At target schools, banks come to campus. At non-target schools, you go to the banks—one email at a time. Networking isn't optional for non-target students; it's the entire strategy. Without it, your online applications disappear into a black hole.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's the complete networking playbook that actually gets non-target students into investment banking.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Non-Target Networking Reality</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Let's be direct about the numbers:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Target school students</strong> can often land interviews with 10-20 networking calls plus on-campus recruiting access.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Non-target students</strong> typically need 80-150+ cold emails, 40-60+ completed calls, and 3-5 strong advocates to have a realistic shot at interviews.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This isn't meant to discourage you—it's meant to set realistic expectations so you don't give up after 20 emails with no responses. The process works, but it requires volume and persistence.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Three Types of Connections to Target</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Tier 1: Alumni (Highest Response Rate)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Alumni from your school—even if it's not a target—feel an obligation to help current students. This is your warmest outreach.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">How to find them:</strong>
- LinkedIn search: "[Your School]" + "Investment Banking"
- Your school's alumni database
- Career services alumni lists
- Ask professors for introductions</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why they respond:</strong> Shared identity creates implicit trust. They remember what it was like to recruit from your school.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Tier 2: Regional/Geographic Connections</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">People from your hometown, state, or region have an affinity that can substitute for alumni ties.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">How to use it:</strong>
- "I'm from [City] and noticed you're originally from [same area]"
- Reference local landmarks, sports teams, or experiences
- Works particularly well for smaller cities or regions with tight-knit communities</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Tier 3: Cold Outreach (Lowest Response Rate, Highest Volume)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">When you have no shared connection, you're relying purely on their goodwill and your email quality.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">What improves cold response rates:</strong>
- Reference a specific deal they worked on
- Demonstrate genuine knowledge of their group/coverage
- Be concise and professional
- Follow up appropriately</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The 100-Email Framework</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Phase 1: Build Your List (Week 1)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Create a spreadsheet with these columns:
- Name, Title, Bank, Group
- Email address
- Connection type (alumni, geographic, cold)
- LinkedIn profile link
- Date sent, Follow-up dates
- Response status
- Call scheduled (Y/N)
- Notes</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Target:</strong> 100+ names before you start sending.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Sources:</strong>
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (if available) or regular LinkedIn search
- Bank websites (team pages)
- Deal announcements (find who worked on deals)
- Alumni databases</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Phase 2: Prioritize and Segment (Week 1)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Sort your list by connection strength:
1. <strong class="text-charcoal">Direct alumni</strong> (same school, any level) — Email first
2. <strong class="text-charcoal">Alumni of alumni connections</strong> (someone who knows your alumni) — Email second
3. <strong class="text-charcoal">Geographic connections</strong> — Email third
4. <strong class="text-charcoal">Cold outreach</strong> — Fill in gaps</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Within each tier, prioritize:</strong>
- Analysts and Associates (more likely to respond, closer to your level)
- VPs (good balance of access and willingness to help)
- MDs (lower response rate, but powerful if they respond)</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Phase 3: Execute at Volume (Weeks 2-8)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Weekly targets:</strong>
- Send 15-20 new emails per week
- Follow up on all non-responses from previous weeks
- Complete 5-10 calls per week (as responses come in)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Tracking discipline:</strong>
- Update your spreadsheet daily
- Log every response (positive or negative)
- Note key takeaways from every call</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Phase 4: Convert Calls to Advocates (Ongoing)</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Not every call needs to become a deep relationship. But you need 3-5 people who will actively push for you.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Signs someone might become an advocate:</strong>
- They offer to connect you with others
- They ask about your timeline and target firms
- They express genuine interest in helping
- They follow up with you proactively</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">How to nurture potential advocates:</strong>
- Send thank-you emails within 24 hours
- Provide updates on your progress (every 4-6 weeks)
- Share relevant articles or insights occasionally
- Ask for specific help when appropriate (not too often)</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Anatomy of a Great Networking Call</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Before the Call (5 min)
- Review their LinkedIn and background
- Prepare 3-4 specific questions
- Have your story ready (2-minute "walk me through your resume")</h3><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Opening (2 min)
- Thank them for their time
- Brief introduction (who you are, why you reached out)</h3><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Their Story (8-10 min)
- "How did you get into banking?"
- "What's your group's focus?"
- "What do you enjoy most about the work?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Let them talk. People enjoy sharing their experience, and you learn valuable information.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Your Questions (5-7 min)
- Specific questions about their group, deals, or career path
- Questions about recruiting timeline and process
- Ask for advice specific to your situation</h3><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">The Close (2-3 min)
**Critical question:** "Is there anyone else you'd recommend I speak with?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is how you expand your network exponentially. Every call should generate 1-2 new names.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">After the Call
- Send thank-you email within 24 hours
- Connect on LinkedIn (mention the call)
- Add any referrals to your outreach list immediately</h3><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Following Up Without Being Annoying</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">The Follow-Up Cadence</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">After initial email (no response):</strong>
- Wait 5-7 business days
- Send a short bump: "Just wanted to bump this in case it got buried"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">After first follow-up (no response):</strong>
- Wait another 5-7 days
- Final attempt: "I'll try one last time—if you're too busy, is there someone else you'd recommend?"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">After two follow-ups:</strong> Move on. Don't email again for 6 months.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">After a Completed Call</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Immediate (within 24 hours):</strong>
- Thank-you email</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">4-6 weeks later:</strong>
- Progress update: "Wanted to share an update—I just landed an internship at [Firm] and wanted to thank you again for your advice"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">When something relevant happens:</strong>
- "I saw [Bank] just closed [Deal]—congratulations to the team"</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Common Non-Target Networking Mistakes</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 1: Giving Up Too Early</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Many students send 20-30 emails, get discouraged by low response rates, and quit. The students who break in send 100+.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 2: Only Targeting Senior Bankers</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">MDs are busy and have low response rates. Analysts and Associates remember what recruiting was like and are more likely to help.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 3: Asking for a Job in the First Email</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Your first email asks for advice and information. Mentioning job-seeking triggers an automatic "talk to HR" response.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 4: Not Tracking Rigorously</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Without a system, you'll lose track of who you've contacted, who needs follow-up, and what you learned.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Mistake 5: Treating Networking as a One-Time Event</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Networking isn't just for recruiting season. Build relationships year-round. The person you talk to sophomore year might help you junior year.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What to Do When Someone Offers to Help</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">When someone says "Let me know how I can help" or "I'll put in a word," follow up appropriately:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">If they offer a referral:</strong>
> "Thank you so much—I really appreciate that. I'll have my resume ready to send over. Is there anything specific you'd recommend I highlight?"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">If they offer to connect you with others:</strong>
> "That would be incredibly helpful. I'll send over a brief intro paragraph you can forward if that makes it easier."</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">If they offer general advice:</strong>
> "Thank you—I'll definitely keep that in mind as I continue recruiting. Would it be okay if I reach out in a few weeks with an update on how things are going?"</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Advocate Effect</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's why all this matters: When recruiting decisions are made, having someone inside the bank who knows your name changes everything.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Without an advocate:</strong> Your resume is one of thousands. HR screens by GPA and school name. You're filtered out before a human reviews you.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">With an advocate:</strong> A VP mentions your name to recruiting. HR pulls your resume for review. You get an interview you wouldn't have gotten otherwise.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is how non-target students break in. Not by being the most qualified on paper—but by having someone on the inside who can vouch for them.</p><hr class="my-10 border-gold/30" /><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><em>Want 50+ email templates for every scenario?
