b:T2d3a,<p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
After the DCF, comparable company analysis ("trading comps") and precedent transaction analysis ("transaction comps" or "deal comps") are the other two pillars of the valuation toolkit. Every IB interview will test whether you understand how these work and when to use which.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Trading Comps: The Process</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Trading comps value a company by comparing it to similar public companies. The logic is simple: if comparable businesses trade at 10x EBITDA, and your company generates $100M EBITDA, it's worth approximately $1B.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 1: Select the Peer Universe</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Choose 5-15 comparable public companies based on:
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Industry/sector</strong> — Same industry classification
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Size</strong> — Similar revenue and market cap
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Geography</strong> — Same market or region
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Growth profile</strong> — Similar revenue growth rates
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Margins</strong> — Comparable operating margins
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Business model</strong> — Similar product/service mix</p><blockquote class="pl-4 border-l-4 border-gold bg-gold/5 py-3 pr-4 rounded-r-lg text-charcoal/80 italic my-4"><strong class="text-charcoal">RED FLAG:</strong> Many candidates pick comps that are too broad. "They're both tech companies" isn't a comp rationale. A cloud SaaS company and a hardware manufacturer are both "tech" but have completely different economics.</blockquote><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 2: Gather Financial Data</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">For each comp, collect:
- Current share price and market cap
- Enterprise value (EV)
- LTM (Last Twelve Months) and forward financials: Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income
- Growth rates and margins</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">LTM vs. Forward:</strong> LTM is backward-looking (actual results). Forward uses analyst consensus estimates. Forward multiples are generally more relevant because they reflect expected performance.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 3: Calculate Multiples</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Common trading multiples:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">| Multiple | Formula | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| EV/Revenue | EV ÷ Revenue | Pre-profit companies, high-growth |
| EV/EBITDA | EV ÷ EBITDA | Most common, capital-structure neutral |
| EV/EBIT | EV ÷ EBIT | When D&A varies significantly across comps |
| P/E | Price ÷ EPS | Mature, stable earnings companies |
| P/BV | Price ÷ Book Value | Financial institutions |</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 4: Analyze and Apply</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Calculate mean, median, and range of multiples across the comp set. Apply to the target company:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Example:</strong> Median EV/EBITDA of comps = 11.5x. Target EBITDA = $200M.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Implied EV = 11.5 × $200M = <strong class="text-charcoal">$2.3B</strong></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Subtract net debt to get implied equity value. Divide by diluted shares for implied share price.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Always present a range</strong>, not a single number. Use the 25th-75th percentile of the comp set to establish a valuation range.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Precedent Transactions: The Process</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Precedent transactions value a company based on what acquirers have actually paid for similar companies. These reflect <em>control</em> value—what someone paid to own the entire business.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 1: Identify Relevant Transactions</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Search for M&A deals involving companies similar to the target. Key criteria:
- Same industry/sector
- Similar size
- Recent (typically within 2-5 years)
- Similar deal rationale (strategic vs. financial buyer)</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 2: Calculate Transaction Multiples</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">For each deal:
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Transaction Value</strong> (enterprise value paid by acquirer)
- <strong class="text-charcoal">Target's LTM financials</strong> at the time of the deal</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Common transaction multiples: EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT (same as trading comps, but based on prices paid, not current trading prices).</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Step 3: Apply to Target</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Same application as trading comps—use the median/mean multiple and apply to the target's metrics.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Control Premium: Why Precedent Transactions Are Higher</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is the interview question that always comes up:</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><em>"Why are precedent transaction multiples typically higher than trading comps?"</em></p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">The control premium.</strong> When an acquirer buys a company, they pay a premium above the current market price because:</p><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Synergies</strong> — The acquirer expects to realize cost savings or revenue synergies</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Control</strong> — Owning 100% lets you make strategic decisions (restructure, divest units, change management)</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><strong class="text-charcoal">Competitive bidding</strong> — Multiple bidders can drive up the price</li></ol><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The control premium typically ranges from <strong class="text-charcoal">20-40%</strong> above the unaffected trading price.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Trading Comps vs. Precedent Transactions vs. DCF</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">| Feature | Trading Comps | Precedent Transactions | DCF |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|-----|
| Based on | Market pricing | Actual deal prices | Intrinsic cash flows |
| Reflects | Minority value | Control value | Intrinsic value |
| Sensitivity | Market conditions | Deal conditions | Assumptions |
| Best for | Relative comparison | M&A pricing | Absolute value |
| Weakness | Peer selection bias | Stale data | Assumption sensitivity |</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Which valuation method gives the highest value?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">General rule of thumb (not always true):
1. <strong class="text-charcoal">Precedent transactions</strong> — Highest (includes control premium)
2. <strong class="text-charcoal">DCF</strong> — Middle (depends heavily on assumptions)
3. <strong class="text-charcoal">Trading comps</strong> — Lowest (reflects minority, no-control value)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">But this varies. In a hot market, trading comps could exceed transaction multiples. A DCF with aggressive assumptions could exceed everything.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"If you had to choose one method, which would you pick?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Strong answer: <em>"I wouldn't rely on just one—each method captures different information. But if forced, I'd pick the DCF because it's based on the company's fundamental cash-generating ability rather than the market's mood or the specifics of past deals. However, I'd always cross-check with comps to make sure my DCF isn't producing unreasonable multiples."</em></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Valuation Football Field</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">In practice, you present all three methodologies side by side in a "football field" chart—horizontal bars showing the valuation range from each method. This gives the client (or your interviewer) a visual picture of where value likely falls.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">The overlap zone where multiple methodologies agree is typically the most defensible valuation range.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">Common Interview Questions</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"Walk me through how you'd run a comps analysis for [Company X]."</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Use the 4-step framework above. Emphasize peer selection criteria and why you'd choose specific comps. Mention that you'd use forward multiples and present a range.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"What's the biggest limitation of comps analysis?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">No two companies are truly comparable.</strong> Every company has unique characteristics—growth trajectory, margin profile, management quality, market position—that make perfect comparisons impossible. The analyst's judgment in selecting comps introduces subjectivity.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">"When would you weight precedent transactions more heavily?"</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">When the engagement is specifically about an M&A transaction and you need to understand what buyers have historically been willing to pay. The control premium embedded in these multiples is directly relevant.</p><hr class="my-10 border-gold/30" /><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Related Reading</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4 ml-4"><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/enterprise-value-vs-equity-value-explained" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Enterprise Value vs. Equity Value Explained</a> — Why EV-based multiples matter</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/walk-me-through-dcf-perfect-answer" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Walk Me Through a DCF: The Perfect Answer</a> — The intrinsic valuation method</li><li class="text-charcoal/80"><a href="/blog/accretion-dilution-analysis-explained" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">Accretion/Dilution Analysis Explained</a> — What happens after the deal</li></ul><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><em>This covers the key concepts from Chapter 4 of our <a href="/playbooks/ib-technical-guide" class="text-gold hover:text-navy underline">IB Technical Interview Guide</a>.
