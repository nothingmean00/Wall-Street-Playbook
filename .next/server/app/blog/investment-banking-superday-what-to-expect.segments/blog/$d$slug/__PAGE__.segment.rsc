You survived the phone screens and first rounds. Now comes the Superday—the final stage where banks make their hiring decisions. Everything you've worked for comes down to this one day of back-to-back interviews.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Here's exactly what to expect and how to maximize your chances.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What Is a Superday?</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">A Superday is the final round of investment banking interviews, typically consisting of 4-6 back-to-back interviews at the bank's office. Each interview runs 30-45 minutes, and you'll meet people ranging from analysts to managing directors.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Why "Superday"?</strong>
Because the bank compresses all final interviews into a single (super long) day, then makes decisions quickly—often within 24-48 hours.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Typical Superday Structure</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">8:30 AM:</strong> Arrive at the office. Check in with HR/recruiting. Wait in a conference room with other candidates.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">9:00 AM - 12:30 PM:</strong> First 3-4 interviews. Mix of analysts/associates and VPs/Directors.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">12:30 PM:</strong> Lunch (usually with junior bankers—this is still an interview, stay engaged).</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">1:30 PM - 4:00 PM:</strong> Remaining 2-3 interviews. Often includes at least one senior MD.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">4:00 PM:</strong> Wrap-up with recruiting. They may tell you next steps or timeline.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">What Each Interviewer Tests</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Analyst/Associate Interviews
- Technical questions (DCF, accounting, LBO basics)

- Deeper technical questions

- What makes a good LBO candidate?
- Where do you see interest rates going?</h3><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">How to Prepare</h2><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">The Week Before</h3><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Technical review:</strong>
