You can have a 4.0 GPA from Wharton and know how to build an LBO model in your sleep, but if you fail the "Airport Test," you will not get an offer.</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">Investment banking interviews are split 50/50 between technicals and behaviorals. Technicals are binary—you're either right or wrong. Behaviorals are subjective. They answer the only question that matters to a VP at 2 AM: <em>"Can I stand to be around this person for 100 hours a week?"</em></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">The Anchor: "Walk Me Through Your Resume"</h2><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">This is the first question in 99% of interviews.

The Spark (The Beginning):</strong> Start with where you're from and the initial trigger for your interest.
> "I grew up in Chicago and first got interested in finance when I started trading my own small portfolio in high school…"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">2. The Growing Interest (College):</strong> Move to your university choice and relevant activities.
> "I chose [University] because of its strong business program. I joined the Investment Banking Club freshman year…"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">3. The Professional Pivot (Internships):</strong> Walk through work experience. For each role, explain what you did and why you moved.
> "Last summer, I worked at [Firm]. While I enjoyed the client interaction, I realized I wanted larger, transaction-based deals, which led me to target investment banking…"</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">4. The "Why You're Here" (The Close):</strong> Bring it to the present.

<strong class="text-charcoal">Bad:</strong> "I love finance and modeling." (You can do that in accounting)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Good (The "High-Stakes" Angle):</strong>
> "I want to work in investment banking because I thrive in high-pressure environments where my work has tangible impact. In my last internship, I loved the intensity of [Project], but I wanted to be closer to transaction execution.

1. <strong class="text-charcoal">Have Hobbies:</strong> If asked "What do you do for fun?", don't say "Read the Wall Street Journal." Say "I'm training for a marathon" or "I'm trying to cook every recipe in this cookbook."
2. <strong class="text-charcoal">Smile and Banter:</strong> If they ask "How are you?", don't just say "Good." Say "Doing well, though I'm ready for this Chicago winter to be over. How's your week going?"
3. <strong class="text-charcoal">Read the Room:</strong> Mirror their energy. If serious, be professional.

<strong class="text-charcoal">Don't say:</strong> "I'm bad at math" (Disqualifying)</p><p class="text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-charcoal">Do say:</strong> A real weakness you're actively fixing.
