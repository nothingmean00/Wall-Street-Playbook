Technical questions typically make up 50-70% of analyst-level interviews."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long should I prepare for investment banking interviews?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Preparation takes 3-6 months for most candidates. The timeline includes: 6-12 months before for learning accounting fundamentals and networking, 3-6 months before for mastering valuation and practicing technicals daily, 1-3 months before for mock interviews and refining your story, and final weeks for reviewing weak areas."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What accounting topics should I know for IB interviews?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You should master: walking through the three financial statements, how the statements link together, what happens when depreciation increases by $10, and why cash flow is more important than net income. Understanding these fundamentals is essential before moving to valuation topics."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What valuation questions are asked in investment banking interviews?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Common valuation questions include: what are the three main valuation methodologies, walk me through a DCF, when would you use a DCF vs comparable companies, and what's the difference between enterprise value and equity value."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How important is networking for investment banking recruiting?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Networking is non-negotiable, especially from non-target schools. Plan for 50-100+ outreach messages and 30-50 networking calls to build meaningful relationships. Follow up every 5-7 days.
