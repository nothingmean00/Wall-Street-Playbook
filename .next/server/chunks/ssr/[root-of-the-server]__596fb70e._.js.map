Both paths offer exceptional compensation and career optionality, but they differ fundamentally in day-to-day work, skill development, and long-term trajectory.\n\n## Compensation Comparison\n\nAt the analyst level, total compensation is remarkably similar. First-year IB analysts at bulge brackets typically earn $110-130K base with bonuses pushing total comp to $170-200K. PE associates at mega-funds start slightly higher, with total compensation often reaching $250-350K by year two.\n\nThe divergence accelerates at senior levels. Managing Directors in investment banking can earn $1-5M+ annually, while Partners at top PE firms may earn $5-20M+ through carried interest distributions.\n\n## The Work Itself\n\nInvestment banking centers on execution. You are building models, preparing materials, and supporting live transactions. The work is intense but relatively predictable in structure. PE involves more investment decision-making, portfolio company oversight, and strategic work.\n\nThe hours narrative requires nuance. While IB hours are notoriously brutal (80-100+ hours weekly is common), PE hours at mega-funds often match this during deal processes. The difference lies in predictability and control—PE offers more autonomy over scheduling.\n\n## Exit Opportunities\n\nThis is where paths diverge significantly. IB provides broad optionality: PE, hedge funds, corporate development, venture capital, or operating roles. PE narrows focus toward deeper investing roles, portfolio operations, or launching your own fund.\n\nNeither path is superior. The right choice depends on whether you prefer transaction execution or investment ownership, and where you want to be in 15 years.\n    `,\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"breaking-in-non-target\",\n    title: \"Breaking In From a Non-Target School\",\n    summary: \"Specific strategies for candidates without traditional pedigree to land top-tier roles.\",\n    category: \"Recruiting\",\n    readTime: \"10 min read\",\n    publishedAt: \"2024-11-28\",\n    content: `\nEvery year, candidates from non-target schools break into Goldman Sachs, Evercore, and other top-tier firms. The path is harder, but it is well-defined for those willing to execute.\n\n## The Reality Check\n\nNon-target recruiting requires starting earlier, working harder, and being more strategic than your target-school competition. You cannot rely on on-campus recruiting or alumni density. You must manufacture every advantage.\n\n## The Networking Imperative\n\nYour entire strategy centers on one activity: building relationships with people who can refer you or advocate for your candidacy. This means 50-100+ networking conversations before recruiting begins.\n\nStart with second-degree connections: alumni from your school, friends of friends, people from your hometown. Expand from there. Every conversation should end with two new names to contact.\n\n## The Technical Edge\n\nWhen you lack the pedigree, you compensate with preparation. Non-target candidates who break in are often more technically prepared than their target-school peers because they had to be.\n\nMaster technicals before recruiting begins. Not during—before. Your accounting, valuation, and deal knowledge should be flawless.\n\n## The Story\n\nYour narrative must be airtight. Why finance? Why now? Why you despite your school? The best non-target candidates frame their background as an asset: grit, resourcefulness, and the drive that comes from having to earn every opportunity.\n\nThe path is harder. But for candidates willing to execute this playbook, it works.\n    `,\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"lbo-modeling-fundamentals\",\n    title: \"LBO Modeling Fundamentals\",\n    summary: \"Core concepts and key drivers behind leveraged buyout analysis.\",\n    category: \"Technical\",\n    readTime: \"12 min read\",\n    publishedAt: \"2024-11-25\",\n    content: `\nLeveraged buyout models form the analytical backbone of private equity. Understanding LBO mechanics is essential for anyone targeting buyside roles.\n\n## The Basic Structure\n\nAn LBO uses significant debt to acquire a company, with the goal of improving operations and selling at a higher valuation. The sponsor (PE firm) contributes equity, typically 30-40% of the purchase price, with debt financing the remainder.\n\n## The Five Value Creation Levers\n\nPE firms create value through five primary mechanisms:\n\n1. **Revenue Growth** - Organic growth, M&A, geographic expansion\n2. **Margin Improvement** - Cost reduction, pricing power, operational efficiency  \n3. **Multiple Expansion** - Selling at a higher EV/EBITDA than purchase\n4. **Debt Paydown** - Using cash flows to reduce leverage, increasing equity value\n5. **Cash Generation** - Dividends and distributions during the hold period\n\n## Key Return Metrics\n\nIRR (Internal Rate of Return) and MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) are the core metrics. A typical target is 20%+ IRR and 2.0x+ MOIC over a 5-year hold period.\n\nThe math is straightforward: buy low, improve the business, sell higher, and use debt leverage to amplify equity returns. Execution is where complexity lives.\n\n## What Interviewers Test\n\nTechnical interviews focus on: sources and uses, debt structure, cash flow available for debt repayment, and sensitivity to key assumptions. Know how changing revenue growth, margins, and exit multiples impact returns.\n    `,\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"superday-preparation\",\n    title: \"Superday Preparation Checklist\",\n    summary: \"Hour-by-hour preparation framework for final round interviews.\",\n    category: \"Interviews\",\n    readTime: \"6 min read\",\n    publishedAt: \"2024-11-20\",\n    content: `\nSuperdays are where offers are won or lost. After months of preparation and multiple interview rounds, everything comes down to one day of back-to-back interviews.

New learning this close to the event indicates under-preparation.\n\nFinalize your stories. You should have 5-7 polished narratives covering leadership, teamwork, failure, and conflict. These should be rehearsed but not robotic.\n\nResearch every interviewer if names are provided. LinkedIn, recent deals, published articles. Find connection points.\n\n## The Night Before\n\nPrepare everything physical: suit pressed, shoes polished, copies of resume, notepad. Eliminate morning decisions.\n\nSleep is non-negotiable. Aim for 7-8 hours. No late-night cramming—it costs more in alertness than it gains in knowledge.\n\n## The Morning Of\n\nArrive 15-20 minutes early. Use the time to calm nerves, not to cram.\n\nEat a real breakfast. Your brain needs fuel for 4-6 hours of high-intensity interviewing.\n\n## During the Day\n\nEnergy management matters. Stay hydrated. Use breaks to reset mentally, not to review notes.\n\nTreat every interview as if it is the first. Do not let a difficult interview affect subsequent ones. Interviewers rarely compare notes mid-day.\n\n## The Debrief\n\nSend thank-you notes within 24 hours. Brief, specific, professional.

The right approach dramatically improves response rates.\n\n## The Fundamentals\n\nKeep it short. Three to four sentences maximum.

Reference something specific: a shared background, a deal they worked on, an article they wrote.\n\n## Email Structure That Works\n\n**Subject Line:** Keep it direct. \"Quick Question - [Firm] [Group]\" or \"[Mutual Connection] Suggested I Reach Out\"\n\n**Opening:** One sentence establishing who you are and why you are contacting them specifically.\n\n**Middle:** One sentence on what you are trying to learn or accomplish.\n\n**Close:** The specific ask with a timeframe. \"Would you have 15 minutes this week or next for a brief call?\"\n\n## Timing Matters\n\nSend emails Tuesday through Thursday, between 8-10 AM or 7-9 PM in the recipient's timezone. Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons.\n\nFollow up once after 5-7 business days if no response. A brief \"bumping this to the top of your inbox\" is sufficient.

If you cannot summarize your thesis in one sentence, you do not have a thesis.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nExplain what the company does in 2-3 sentences. Assume the interviewer has basic knowledge but has not studied this specific company.\n\nCover: what they sell, who buys it, how they make money, and what drives unit economics.\n\n## The Variant Perception\n\nThis is where most pitches fail. A variant perception is a view that differs from consensus and has a reasonable probability of proving correct.\n\n\"The company will grow revenue\" is not a variant perception—everyone expects that. \"The company will grow revenue 20% faster than consensus because of X factor the market is underappreciating\" is a variant perception.\n\n## Catalysts\n\nWhy will the market recognize your thesis in a reasonable timeframe? Catalysts include: earnings releases, new product launches, strategic announcements, regulatory changes, or management actions.\n\n## Valuation\n\nSupport your price target with clear methodology. Relative valuation (comps) and intrinsic valuation (DCF) together strengthen the case.\n\n## Risks and Mitigants\n\nEvery investment has risks.

Build bull/bear cases.\n**Days 5-6:** Prepare presentation. Rehearse delivery. Anticipate questions.\n\n## Live Cases\n\nYou have 2-4 hours with limited materials. Efficiency is paramount.\n\nFirst 30 minutes: Understand the business and identify 2-3 key issues.\nMiddle 60-90 minutes: Build a simple model. Make and support your decision.\nFinal 30 minutes: Prepare a clear recommendation with key supporting points.\n\n## What Separates Candidates\n\nThe best candidates demonstrate investment judgment, not just modeling ability. They identify the one or two factors that truly determine whether an investment works and focus their analysis there.\n\nAverage candidates try to analyze everything. Strong candidates prioritize ruthlessly.\n    `,\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"compensation-negotiation\",\n    title: \"Negotiating Your Finance Offer\",\n    summary: \"When and how to negotiate compensation in banking and buyside roles.\",\n    category: \"Career Strategy\",\n    readTime: \"5 min read\",\n    publishedAt: \"2024-10-28\",\n    content: `\nCompensation negotiation in finance follows different rules than other industries. Understanding when and how to negotiate prevents costly mistakes.\n\n## The Reality of Entry-Level Offers\n\nJunior offers at bulge brackets and major PE firms are typically non-negotiable. These firms make hundreds of similar offers annually and maintain strict pay bands for fairness and efficiency.\n\nAttempting to negotiate a first-year analyst offer at Goldman Sachs signals you do not understand the industry. This can create negative impressions before you start.\n\n## When Negotiation Works\n\nNegotiation becomes appropriate as you gain seniority and market alternatives. Associate and VP lateral moves, especially to smaller firms or those actively competing for talent, offer negotiation room.\n\nSigning bonuses are often more flexible than base salary, particularly for candidates leaving guaranteed money on the table.\n\n## The Approach\n\nLead with your value, not your needs. \"Given my deal experience in X sector and my relationships with Y clients, I believe a higher signing bonus reflects my immediate contribution.\"\n\nHave alternatives. Real leverage comes from competing offers or the credible ability to stay in your current role.\n\n## What Not to Do\n\nNever negotiate without an offer in hand. Never use personal expenses as justification. Never accept verbally then try to renegotiate written terms.\n\nThe goal is to optimize your compensation while maintaining the relationship. Finance is a small industry with long memories.\n    `,\n  },\n]\n\nexport const featuredPlaybooks = playbooks.slice(0, 3)\n\nexport const featuredGuides = guides.slice(0, 3)\n","import type {
